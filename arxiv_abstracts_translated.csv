2,"  There is no doubt that Search Engines are playing a great role in Internet
usage. But all the top search engines Google, Yahoo and Bing are having a
critical flaw called ""Openness of a Search Engine"". An Internet user should be
allowed to get the search results only when requested through Search engine's
web page but the user must not be allowed to get the search results when
requested through any web page that does not belong to the Search Engine. Only
results of a search engine should be available to the Internet user but not the
Search Engine. This paper explains the critical flaw called ""Openness of Search
Engine"" with a case study on top 3 search engines 'Google', 'Yahoo' and 'Bing'.
This paper conducts an attack based test using J2EE framework and proves that
'Google' passed the test and it strongly protects its Critical Search System,
where 'Yahoo' and 'Bing' are failed to protect their Search Engines. But
previously 'Google' also had other high severity issues with the Openness of

4,"  Game engines help developers create video games and avoid duplication of code
and effort, like frameworks for traditional software systems. In this paper, we
explore open-source game engines along three perspectives: literature, code,
and human. First, we explore and summarise the academic literature on game
engines. Second, we compare the characteristics of the 282 most popular engines
and the 282 most popular frameworks in GitHub. Finally, we survey 124 engine
developers about their experience with the development of their engines. We
report that: (1) Game engines are not well-studied in software-engineering
research with few studies having engines as object of research. (2) Open-source
game engines are slightly larger in terms of size and complexity and less
popular and engaging than traditional frameworks. Their programming languages
differ greatly from frameworks. Engine projects have shorter histories with
less releases. (3) Developers perceive game engines as different from
traditional frameworks. Generally, they build game engines to (a) better
control the environment and source code, (b) learn about game engines, and (c)
develop specific games. We conclude that open-source game engines have
differences compared to traditional open-source frameworks although this
differences do not demand special treatments.

5,"  Database systems are becoming increasingly multi-engine. In particular, a
main-memory database engine may coexist with a traditional storage-centric
engine in a system to support various applications. It is desirable to allow
applications to access data in both engines using cross-engine transactions.
But existing systems are either only designed for single-engine accesses, or
impose many restrictions by limiting cross-engine transactions to certain
isolation levels and table operations. The result is inadequate cross-engine
support in terms of correctness, performance and programmability.
  This paper describes Skeena, a holistic approach to cross-engine
transactions. We propose a lightweight snapshot tracking structure and an
atomic commit protocol to efficiently ensure correctness and support various
isolation levels. Evaluation results show that Skeena maintains high
performance for single-engine transactions and enables cross-engine
transactions which can improve throughput by up to 30x by judiciously placing
tables in different engines.

continuing technological progress of searching the information by using tools
like Search Engines gives rise to many problems for the user to know which tool
is best for their query and which tool is not. At this time Metasearch Engine
comes into play by reducing the user burden by dispatching queries to multiple
search engines in parallel and refining the results of these search engines to
give the best out of best by doing superior job on their side. These engines do
not own a database of Web pages rather they send search terms to the databases
maintained by the search engine companies, get back results from all the search
engines queried and then compile the results to be presented to the user. In
this paper, we describe the working of a typical metasearch engine and then
present a comparative study of traditional search engines and metasearch
engines on the basis of different parameters and show how metasearch engines
are better than the other search engines.

the mechanical work performed is dissipated within the engine at the
temperature of the warmer isotherm and the resulting heat is added to the
engine together with an external heat input. The resulting work performed by
the engine per cycle is increased at the expense of dissipated work produced in
the previous cycle. It is shown that such a dissipative heat engine is
thermodynamically inconsistent violating the first and second laws of
thermodynamics. The existing physical models employing the dissipative heat

14,"  Background: Academic search engines (i.e., digital libraries and indexers)
play an increasingly important role in systematic reviews however these engines
do not seem to effectively support such reviews, e.g., researchers confront
usability issues with the engines when conducting their searches. Aims: To
investigate whether the usability issues are bugs (i.e., faults in the search
engines) or constraints, and to provide recommendations to search-engine
providers and researchers on how to tackle these issues. Method: Using
snowball-sampling from tertiary studies, we identify a set of 621 secondary
studies in software engineering. By physically re-attempting the searches for
all of these 621 studies, we effectively conduct regression testing for 42
search engines. Results: We identify 13 bugs for eight engines, and also
identify other constraints. We provide recommendations for tackling these
issues. Conclusions: There is still a considerable gap between the search-needs
of researchers and the usability of academic search engines. It is not clear
whether search-engine developers are aware of this gap. Also, the evaluation,
by academics, of academic search engines has not kept pace with the
development, by search-engine providers, of those search engines. Thus, the gap
between evaluation and development makes it harder to properly understand the

15,"  This paper investigates the composition of search engine results pages. We
define what elements the most popular web search engines use on their results
pages (e.g., organic results, advertisements, shortcuts) and to which degree
they are used for popular vs. rare queries. Therefore, we send 500 queries of
both types to the major search engines Google, Yahoo, Live.com and Ask. We
count how often the different elements are used by the individual engines. In
total, our study is based on 42,758 elements. Findings include that search
engines use quite different approaches to results pages composition and
therefore, the user gets to see quite different results sets depending on the
search engine and search query used. Organic results still play the major role
in the results pages, but different shortcuts are of some importance, too.
Regarding the frequency of certain host within the results sets, we find that
all search engines show Wikipedia results quite often, while other hosts shown
depend on the search engine used. Both Google and Yahoo prefer results from
their own offerings (such as YouTube or Yahoo Answers). Since we used the .com

protect against social engineering attacks, a fundamental work is to know what
constitutes social engineering. This paper first develops a domain ontology of
social engineering in cybersecurity and conducts ontology evaluation by its
knowledge graph application. The domain ontology defines 11 concepts of core
entities that significantly constitute or affect social engineering domain,
together with 22 kinds of relations describing how these entities related to
each other. It provides a formal and explicit knowledge schema to understand,
analyze, reuse and share domain knowledge of social engineering. Furthermore,

patterns) demonstrate that the ontology together with knowledge graph is useful
to 1) understand and analyze social engineering attack scenario and incident,
2) find the top ranked social engineering threat elements (e.g. the most
exploited human vulnerabilities and most used attack mediums), 3) find
potential social engineering threats to victims, 4) find potential targets for

23,"  We present a principal-agent model of a one-shot, shallow, systems
engineering process. The process is one-shot in the sense that decisions are
made during one time step and that they are final. The term shallow refers to a
one-layer hierarchy of the process. Specifically, we assume that the systems
engineer has already decomposed the problem in subsystems, and that each
subsystem is assigned to a different subsystem engineer. Each subsystem
engineer works independently to maximize their own expected payoff. The goal of
the systems engineer is to maximize the system-level payoff by incentivizing
the subsystem engineers. We restrict our attention to requirement-based
system-level payoffs, i.e., the systems engineer makes a profit only if all the
design requirements are met. We illustrate the model using the design of an
Earth-orbiting satellite system where the systems engineer determines the
optimum incentive structures and requirements for two subsystems: the
propulsion subsystem and the power subsystem. The model enables the analysis of
a systems engineer's decisions about optimal passed-down requirements and
incentives for sub-system engineers under different levels of task difficulty
and associated costs. Sample results, for the case of risk-neutral systems and
subsystems engineers, show that it is not always in the best interest of the
systems engineer to pass down the true requirements. As expected, the model
predicts that for small to moderate task uncertainties the optimal requirements
are higher than the true ones, effectively eliminating the probability of
failure for the systems engineer. In contrast, the model predicts that for
large task uncertainties the optimal requirements should be smaller than the
true ones in order to lure the subsystem engineers into participation.

27,"  Reverse engineering has been a standard practice in the hardware community
for some time. It has only been within the last ten years that reverse
engineering, or ""program comprehension"", has grown into the current
sub-discipline of software engineering. Traditional software engineering is
primarily focused on the development and design of new software. However, most
programmers work on software that other people have designed and developed. Up
to 50% of a software maintainers time can be spent determining the intent of
source code. The growing demand to reevaluate and reimplement legacy software
systems, brought on by the proliferation of clientserver and World Wide Web
technologies, has underscored the need for reverse engineering tools and
techniques. This paper introduces the terminology of reverse engineering and
gives some of the obstacles that make reverse engineering difficult. Although
reverse engineering remains heavily dependent on the human component, a number
of automated tools are presented that aid the reverse engineer.

AB-Space Engine can produce thrust of 10 tons (and more). That can accelerate a
space ship to some thousands of kilometers/second. AB-Space Engine has a
staggering specific impulse owing to the very small mass expended. The AB-Space

29,"  For heat engines working between two heat baths, functionality is often
conditioned on a set of fixed constraints such as given internal structure of
the engine and given temperatures for the baths. It is, however, important to
devise heat engines which can function adaptively, in particular when the
engine is a quantum system and the baths are subject to fluctuations. Here we
study a model for an adaptive quantum heat engine whose heat baths can have
variable temperatures. We obtain conditions under which such an engine can
still operate. Moreover, we propose an enhancement of the heat engine by
coupling it with an appropriate controller which changes the internal structure
of the engine. Interestingly, we prove that this enhanced engine can always
operate and we also obtain conditions for maximum power extraction from this
engine for all temperatures of the heat baths.

detect the temporal occurrence of sounds. In this paper, we apply SED to engine
fault detection by introducing a multimodal SED framework that detects
fine-grained engine faults of automobile engines using audio and
accelerometer-recorded vibration. We first introduce the problem of engine
fault SED on a dataset collected from a large variety of vehicles with
expertly-labeled engine fault sound events. Next, we propose a SED model to
temporally detect ten fine-grained engine faults that occur within vehicle
engines and further explore a pretraining strategy using a large-scale
weakly-labeled engine fault dataset. Through multiple evaluations, we show our
proposed framework is able to effectively detect engine fault sound events.
Finally, we investigate the interaction and characteristics of each modality
and show that fusing features from audio and vibration improves overall engine
fault SED capabilities.

evidenced by increasing publications on topics, e.g., quantum software

set of thoughts about how requirements engineering for quantum software might
differ from that for classical software after making an effort to map classical

36,"  Reverse engineering is a complex process essential to software-security tasks
such as vulnerability discovery and malware analysis. Significant research and
engineering effort has gone into developing tools to support reverse engineers.
However, little work has been done to understand the way reverse engineers
think when analyzing programs, leaving tool developers to make interface design
decisions based only on intuition.
  This paper takes a first step toward a better understanding of reverse
engineers' processes, with the goal of producing insights for improving
interaction design for reverse engineering tools. We present the results of a
semi-structured, observational interview study of reverse engineers (N=16).
Each observation investigated the questions reverse engineers ask as they probe
a program, how they answer these questions, and the decisions they make
throughout the reverse engineering process. From the interview responses, we
distill a model of the reverse engineering process, divided into three phases:
overview, sub-component scanning, and focused experimentation. Each analysis
phase's results feed the next as reverse engineers' mental representations
become more concrete. We find that reverse engineers typically use static
methods in the first two phases, but dynamic methods in the final phase, with
experience playing large, but varying, roles in each phase. % and the role of
experience varies between phases. Based on these results, we provide five
interaction design guidelines for reverse engineering tools.

37,"  We report on the study of student difficulties regarding heat engine in the
context of Stirling cycle within upper-division undergraduate thermal physics
course. An in-class test about a Stirling engine with a regenerator was taken
by three classes, and the students were asked to perform one of the most basic
activities---calculate the efficiency of the heat engine. Our data suggest that
quite a few students have not developed a robust conceptual understanding of
basic engineering knowledge of the heat engine, including the function of the
regenerator and the influence of piston movements on the heat and work involved
in the engine. Most notably, although the science error ratios of the three
classes were similar ($\sim$10\%), the engineering error ratios of the three
classes were high (above 50\%), and the class that was given a simple tutorial
of engineering knowledge of heat engine exhibited significantly smaller
engineering error ratio by about 20\% than the other two classes. In addition,
both the written answers and post-test interviews show that most of the
students can only associate Carnot's theorem with Carnot cycle, but not with
other reversible cycles working between two heat reservoirs, probably because
no enough cycles except Carnot cycle were covered in the traditional
Thermodynamics textbook. Our results suggest that both scientific and
engineering knowledge are important and should be included in instructional
approaches, especially in the Thermodynamics course taught in the countries and
regions with a tradition of not paying much attention to experimental education
or engineering training.

38,"  Heat engines and information engines have each historically served as
motivating examples for the development of thermodynamics. While these two
types of systems are typically thought of as two separate kinds of machines,
recent empirical studies of specific systems have hinted at possible
connections between the two. Inspired by molecular machines in the cellular
environment, which in many cases have separate components in contact with
distinct sources of fluctuations, we study bipartite heat engines. We show that
a bipartite heat engine can only produce net output work by acting as an
information engine. Conversely, information engines can only extract more work
than the work consumed to power them if they have access to different sources
of fluctuations, i.e., act as heat engines. We illustrate these findings first
through an analogy to economics and a cyclically controlled 2D ideal gas. We
then explore two analytically tractable model systems in more detail: a
Brownian-gyrator heat engine which we show can be reinterpreted as a
feedback-cooling information engine, and a quantum-dot information engine which
can be reinterpreted as a thermoelectric heat engine. Our results suggest
design principles for both heat engines and information engines at the
nanoscale, and ultimately imply constraints on how free-energy transduction is
carried out in biological molecular machines.

39,"  We explore the performance of three- and two-stroke heat engines with a
qutrit working substance in charging two-level quantum batteries. We first
classify the heat engines into two groups depending on their working methods.
The first type of heat engine, the sequential engine, evolves through three
distinct strokes, viz., heat, work, and cold strokes. In the second kind of
engine, a simultaneous engine, all the three events are made to occur
simultaneously in one stroke, followed by an additional stroke to thermalize
the working substance, i.e., the qutrit with a cold bath. We further categorize
these two types of engines into two classes depending on the type of
interaction between the working substance and the baths or the battery, viz.,
out-and-out engines, where the system bath interactions can invoke population
transitions between any two energy levels of the qutrit, and fragmented
engines, where only selective transition is materialized. Considering these
four types of heat engines, we analyze the work done by the working substance,
the percentage of charge accumulated by the quantum battery, and the efficiency
of the engine. By drawing a comparison between the charging schemes, we find
that the sequential out-and-out heat engines are most advantageous, providing
unit efficiency and transferring the most energy to the quantum battery, in the
optimal case. The ranking of the benefits obtained from the other three engines
depends on the quantity of interest.

manufacturing plants, using decision tree induction software called Q-YIELD.
The software generates rules for predicting when a given product should be
rejected. The rules are intended to help the process engineers improve the

Experience with Q-YIELD has taught us the importance of data engineering --
preprocessing the data to enable or facilitate decision tree induction. This
paper discusses some of the data engineering problems we have encountered with
semiconductor manufacturing data. The paper deals with two broad classes of
problems: engineering the features in a feature vector representation and
engineering the definition of the target concept (the classes). Manufacturing
process data present special problems for feature engineering, since the data
have multiple levels of granularity (detail, resolution). Engineering the

materialization of data across query operators. In this paper, we study these
two types of query engines in depth and present the limitations and advantages
of each engine. Similarly, the programming languages community has developed
loop fusion techniques to remove intermediate collections in the context of
collection programming. We draw parallels between the DB and PL communities by
demonstrating the connection between pipelined query engines and loop fusion
techniques. Based on this connection, we propose a new type of pull-based
engine, inspired by a loop fusion technique, which combines the benefits of
both approaches. Then we experimentally evaluate the various engines, in the
context of query compilation, for the first time in a fair environment,
eliminating the biasing impact of ancillary optimizations that have
traditionally only been used with one of the approaches. We show that for
realistic analytical workloads, there is no considerable advantage for either
form of pipelined query engine, as opposed to what recent research suggests.
Also, by using microbenchmarks we show that our proposed engine dominates the
existing engines by combining the benefits of both.

46,"  Software Engineering as an industry is highly diverse in terms of development
methods and practices. Practitioners employ a myriad of methods and tend to
further tailor them by e.g. omitting some practices or rules. This diversity in
development methods poses a challenge for software engineering education,
creating a gap between education and industry. General theories such as the
Essence Theory of Software Engineering can help bridge this gap by presenting
software engineering students with higher-level frameworks upon which to build
an understanding of software engineering methods and practical project work. In

could be more challenging than the development of conventional enterprise
software. The authors were involved in a technology-transfer project between
academia and industry which focused on engineering, development and testing of
a software for optimization of pumping energy costs for oil pipelines. Experts
with different skillsets (mechanical, power and software engineers) were
involved. Given the complex nature of the software (a sophisticated underlying
optimization model) and having experts from different fields, there were
challenges in various software engineering aspects of the software system
(e.g., requirements and testing). We report our observations and experience in
addressing those challenges during our technology-transfer project, and aim to
add to the existing body of experience and evidence in engineering of
scientific and engineering software. We believe that our observations,
experience and lessons learnt could be useful for other researchers and
practitioners in engineering of other scientific and engineering software

48,"  There have been growing uses of semantic networks in the past decade, such as
leveraging large-scale pre-trained graph knowledge databases for various
natural language processing (NLP) tasks in engineering design research.
Therefore, the paper provides a survey of the research that has employed
semantic networks in the engineering design research community. The survey
reveals that engineering design researchers have primarily relied on WordNet,
ConceptNet, and other common-sense semantic network databases trained on
non-engineering data sources to develop methods or tools for engineering
design. Meanwhile, there are emerging efforts to mine large scale technical
publication and patent databases to construct engineering-contextualized
semantic network databases, e.g., B-Link and TechNet, to support NLP in
engineering design. On this basis, we recommend future research directions for
the construction and applications of engineering-related semantic networks in
engineering design research and practice.

49,"  Student evaluations of teaching (SET) are commonly used in universities for
assessing teaching quality. However, previous literature shows that in software
engineering students tend to rate certain topics higher than others: In
particular students tend to value programming and software construction over
software design, software engineering models and methods, or soft skills. We
hypothesize that these biases also play a role in SET responses collected from
students. The objective of this study is to investigate how the topic of a
software engineering course affects the SET metrics. We accomplish this by
performing multilevel regression analysis on SET data collected in a software
engineering programme. We analyzed a total of 1295 student evaluations from 46
university courses in a Finnish university. The results of the analysis
verifies that the student course evaluations exhibit similar biases as
distinguished by previous software engineering education research. The type of
the course can predict a higher SET rating. In our dataset, software
construction and programming courses received higher SET ratings compared to
courses on software engineering processes, models, and methods.

to mass markets fast with minimal resources. However, most start-ups fail
before realizing their potential. Poor software engineering, among other
factors, could be a significant contributor to the challenges that start-ups
experience. Little is known about the engineering context in start-up
companies. On the surface, start-ups are characterized by uncertainty, high
risk, and minimal resources. However, such a characterization isn't granular
enough to support identification of specific engineering challenges and to
devise start-up-specific engineering practices. The first step toward an

52,"  Context: Start-up companies have become an important supplier of innovation
and software-intensive products. The flexibility and reactiveness of start-ups
enables fast development and launch of innovative products. However, a majority
of software start-up companies fail before achieving any success. Among other
factors, poor software engineering could be a significant contributor to the
challenges experienced by start-ups. However, the state-of-practice of software
engineering in start-ups, as well as the utilization of state-of-the-art is
largely an unexplored area. Objective: In this study we investigate how
software engineering is applied in start-up context with a focus to identify
key knowledge areas and opportunities for further research. Method: We perform
a multi-vocal exploratory study of 88 start-up experience reports. We develop a
custom taxonomy to categorize the reported software engineering practices and
their interrelation with business aspects, and apply qualitative data analysis
to explore influences and dependencies between the knowledge areas. Results: We
identify the most frequently reported software engineering (requirements
engineering, software design and quality) and business aspect (vision and
strategy development) knowledge areas, and illustrate their relationships. We
also present a summary of how relevant software engineering knowledge areas are
implemented in start-ups and identify potentially useful practices for adoption
in start-ups. Conclusions: The results enable a more focused research on
engineering practices in start-ups. We conclude that most engineering
challenges in start-ups stem from inadequacies in requirements engineering.
Many promising practices to address specific engineering challenges exists,

53,"  Nowadays, engineers need to tackle many unprecedented challenges that are
often complex, and, most importantly, cannot be exhaustively compartmentalized
into a single engineering discipline. In other words, most engineering problems
need to be solved from a multidisciplinary approach. However, conventional
engineering programs usually adopt pedagogical approaches specifically tailored
to traditional, niched engineering disciplines, which become increasingly
deviated from the industry needs as those programs are typically designed and
taught by instructors with highly specialized engineering training and
credentials. To reduce the gap, more multidisciplinary engineering programs
emerge by systematically stretching across all engineering fibers, and
challenge the sub-optimal traditional pedagogy crowded in engineering
classrooms. To further advance future-oriented pedagogy, in this work, we
hypothesized neuro-induced linkages between how cognitively different learners
are and how the linkages would affect learners in the knowledge acquisition
process. We situate the neuro-induced linkages in the context of
multidisciplinary engineering education and propose possible pedagogical
approaches to actualize the implications of this conceptual framework. Our
study, based on the innovative concept of brain fingerprint, would serve as a
pioneer model to theorize key components of learner-centered multidisciplinary
engineering pedagogy which centers on the key question: how do we motivate
engineering students of different backgrounds from a neuro-inspired

80,"  We analyze the efficiency of thermal engines (either quantum or classical)
working with a single heat reservoir like atmosphere. The engine first gets an
energy intake, which can be done in arbitrary non-equilibrium way e.g.
combustion of fuel. Then the engine performs the work and returns to the
initial state. We distinguish two general classes of engines where the working
body first equilibrates within itself and then performs the work (ergodic
engine) or when it performs the work before equilibrating (non-ergodic engine).
We show that in both cases the second law of thermodynamics limits their
efficiency. For ergodic engines we find a rigorous upper bound for the
efficiency, which is strictly smaller than the equivalent Carnot efficiency.
I.e. the Carnot efficiency can be never achieved in single reservoir heat
engines. For non-ergodic engines the efficiency can be higher and can exceed
the equilibrium Carnot bound. By extending the fundamental thermodynamic
relation to nonequilibrium processes, we find a rigorous thermodynamic bound
for the efficiency of both ergodic and non-ergodic engines and show that it is
given by the relative entropy of the non-equilibrium and initial equilibrium
distributions.These results suggest a new general strategy for designing more
efficient engines. We illustrate our ideas by using simple examples.

81,"  There are two types of high-performance graph processing engines: low- and
high-level engines. Low-level engines (Galois, PowerGraph, Snap) provide
optimized data structures and computation models but require users to write
low-level imperative code, hence ensuring that efficiency is the burden of the
user. In high-level engines, users write in query languages like datalog
(SociaLite) or SQL (Grail). High-level engines are easier to use but are orders
of magnitude slower than the low-level graph engines. We present EmptyHeaded, a
high-level engine that supports a rich datalog-like query language and achieves
performance comparable to that of low-level engines. At the core of
EmptyHeaded's design is a new class of join algorithms that satisfy strong
theoretical guarantees but have thus far not achieved performance comparable to
that of specialized graph processing engines. To achieve high performance,
EmptyHeaded introduces a new join engine architecture, including a novel query
optimizer and data layouts that leverage single-instruction multiple data
(SIMD) parallelism. With this architecture, EmptyHeaded outperforms high-level
approaches by up to three orders of magnitude on graph pattern queries,
PageRank, and Single-Source Shortest Paths (SSSP) and is an order of magnitude
faster than many low-level baselines. We validate that EmptyHeaded competes
with the best-of-breed low-level engine (Galois), achieving comparable
performance on PageRank and at most 3x worse performance on SSSP.

82,"  Information engines can use structured environments as a resource to generate
work by randomizing ordered inputs and leveraging the increased Shannon entropy
to transfer energy from a thermal reservoir to a work reservoir. We give a
broadly applicable expression for the work production of an information engine,
generally modeled as a memoryful channel that communicates inputs to outputs as
it interacts with an evolving environment. The expression establishes that an
information engine must have more than one memory state in order to leverage
input environment correlations. To emphasize this functioning, we designed an
information engine powered solely by temporal correlations and not by
statistical biases, as employed by previous engines. Key to this is the
engine's ability to synchronize---the engine automatically returns to a desired
dynamical phase when thrown into an unwanted, dissipative phase by corruptions
in the input---that is, by unanticipated environmental fluctuations. This
self-correcting mechanism is robust up to a critical level of corruption,
beyond which the system fails to act as an engine. We give explicit analytical
expressions for both work and critical corruption level and summarize engine
performance via a thermodynamic-function phase diagram over engine control
parameters. The results reveal a new thermodynamic mechanism based on
nonergodicity that underlies error correction as it operates to support
resilient engineered and biological systems.

engineering majors at home and abroad, including energy and power, mechanical
engineering, civil engineering, aerospace, cryogenic refrigeration, food
engineering, chemical engineering, and environmental engineering, among which
gas power cycle is one of the important contents. However, many Engineering
Thermodynamics textbooks at home and abroad focus only on evaluating the
thermal efficiency of gas power cycle, while the important concept of specific
cycle net work is ignored. Taking an ideal Otto cycle and an ideal Brayton as
examples, the optimum compression ratio (or the pressure ratio) and the maximum
specific cycle net work are analyzed and determined. The ideal Otto and the
ideal Brayton cycles, and also other gas power cycles, are concluded that the
operation under the optimum compression/pressure ratio of the engine, instead
of under the higher efficiency, is more economic and more reasonable. We
concluded that the two very important concepts, i.e., the maximum specific
cycle net work and the optimum compression (or pressure) ratio for the gas
power cycles, should be emphasized in the Engineering Thermodynamics teaching
process and the latter revised or the newly edited textbooks, in order to
better guide the engineering applications. In the end, general T-s diagram is

86,"  Systems engineering processes coordinate the effort of different individuals
to generate a product satisfying certain requirements. As the involved
engineers are self-interested agents, the goals at different levels of the
systems engineering hierarchy may deviate from the system-level goals which may
cause budget and schedule overruns. Therefore, there is a need of a systems
engineering theory that accounts for the human behavior in systems design. To
this end, the objective of this paper is to develop and analyze a
principal-agent model of a one-shot (single iteration), shallow (one level of
hierarchy) systems engineering process. We assume that the systems engineer
maximizes the expected utility of the system, while the subsystem engineers
seek to maximize their expected utilities. Furthermore, the systems engineer is
unable to monitor the effort of the subsystem engineer and may not have a
complete information about their types or the complexity of the design task.
However, the systems engineer can incentivize the subsystem engineers by
proposing specific contracts. To obtain an optimal incentive, we pose and solve
numerically a bi-level optimization problem. Through extensive simulations, we
study the optimal incentives arising from different system-level value
functions under various combinations of effort costs, problem-solving skills,
and task complexities.

development of these systems leads to the production of heat engines with high

transfer of energy between quantum dots and affects thus the engine's behavior.
In this regard, we study the behavior of the work performed by the engine and
the entanglement in the system as the Forster parameter is varied. We find that
the work performed by the engine is affected by the Forster interaction and the

99,"  Typical heat engines exhibit a kind of homotypy: The heat exchanges between a
cyclic heat engine and its two heat reservoirs abide by the same function type;
the forward and backward flows of an autonomous heat engine also conform to the
same function type. This homotypy mathematically reflects in the existence of
hidden symmetries for heat engines. The heat exchanges between the cyclic heat
engine and its two reservoirs are dual under the joint transformation of parity
inversion and time-reversal operation. Similarly, the forward and backward
flows in the autonomous heat engine are also dual under the parity inversion.
With the consideration of these hidden symmetries, we derive a generic
nonlinear constitutive relation up to the quadratic order for tight-coupling
cyclic heat engines and that for tight-coupling autonomous heat engines,
respectively.

101,"  Machine learning models, such as neural networks, decision trees, random
forests, and gradient boosting machines, accept a feature vector, and provide a
prediction. These models learn in a supervised fashion where we provide feature
vectors mapped to the expected output. It is common practice to engineer new
features from the provided feature set. Such engineered features will either
augment or replace portions of the existing feature vector. These engineered
features are essentially calculated fields based on the values of the other
features.
  Engineering such features is primarily a manual, time-consuming task.
Additionally, each type of model will respond differently to different kinds of
engineered features. This paper reports empirical research to demonstrate what
kinds of engineered features are best suited to various machine learning model
types. We provide this recommendation by generating several datasets that we
designed to benefit from a particular type of engineered feature. The
experiment demonstrates to what degree the machine learning model can
synthesize the needed feature on its own. If a model can synthesize a planned
feature, it is not necessary to provide that feature. The research demonstrated
that the studied models do indeed perform differently with various types of
engineered features.

104,"  Software engineers working in large projects must navigate complex
information landscapes. Change Impact Analysis (CIA) is a task that relies on
engineers' successful information seeking in databases storing, e.g., source
code, requirements, design descriptions, and test case specifications. Several
previous approaches to support information seeking are task-specific, thus
understanding engineers' seeking behavior in specific tasks is fundamental. We
present an industrial case study on how engineers seek information in CIA, with
a particular focus on traceability and development artifacts that are not
source code. We show that engineers have different information seeking
behavior, and that some do not consider traceability particularly useful when
conducting CIA. Furthermore, we observe a tendency for engineers to prefer less
rigid types of support rather than formal approaches, i.e., engineers value
support that allows flexibility in how to practically conduct CIA. Finally, due
to diverse information seeking behavior, we argue that future CIA support
should embrace individual preferences to identify change impact by empowering
several seeking alternatives, including searching, browsing, and tracing.

109,"  Certain solutions of Einstein's equations in anti-de Sitter spacetime can be
engineered, using extended gravitational thermodynamics, to yield `holographic
heat engines', devices that turn heat into useful mechanical work. On the other
hand, there are constructions (both experimental and theoretical) where a
series of operations is performed on a small quantum system, defining what are
known as `quantum heat engines'. We propose that certain holographic heat
engines can be considered models of quantum heat engines, and the possible
fruitfulness of this connection is discussed. Motivated by features of quantum
heat engines that take a quantum system through analogues of certain classic
thermodynamic cycles, some black hole Otto and Diesel cycles are presented and
explored for the first time. In the expected regime of overlap, our Otto

110,"  Heat engines constitute the major building blocks of modern technologies.
However, conventional heat engines with higher power yield lesser efficiency
and vice versa and respect various power-efficiency trade-off relations. This
is also assumed to be true for the engines operating in the quantum regime.
Here we show that these relations are not fundamental. We introduce quantum
heat engines that deliver maximum power with Carnot efficiency in the one-shot
finite-size regime. These engines are composed of working systems with a finite
number of quantum particles and are restricted to one-shot measurements. The
engines operate in a one-step cycle by letting the working system
simultaneously interact with hot and cold baths via semi-local thermal
operations. By allowing quantum entanglement between its constituents and,
thereby, a coherent transfer of heat from hot to cold baths, the engine
implements the fastest possible reversible state transformation in each cycle,
resulting in maximum power and Carnot efficiency. Finally, we propose a
physically realizable engine using quantum optical systems.
","The thermal engine is composed of the main components of the latest technology.

111,"  Transformers are the current state-of-the-art of natural language processing
in many domains and are using traction within software engineering research as
well. Such models are pre-trained on large amounts of data, usually from the
general domain. However, we only have a limited understanding regarding the
validity of transformers within the software engineering domain, i.e., how good
such models are at understanding words and sentences within a software
engineering context and how this improves the state-of-the-art. Within this
article, we shed light on this complex, but crucial issue. We compare BERT
transformer models trained with software engineering data with transformers
based on general domain data in multiple dimensions: their vocabulary, their
ability to understand which words are missing, and their performance in
classification tasks. Our results show that for tasks that require
understanding of the software engineering context, pre-training with software

general language understanding, also within the software engineering domain.

112,"  Models are fundamentally crucial to many scientific fields, including
software engineering, systems engineering, enterprise modeling, and business
modeling. This paper focuses on diagrammatic conceptual modeling, as opposed to
mathematical or computational models, wherein a conceptual model is a
translation of reality processes into an abstract mechanism that has similar
structure and parallel events of the external processes. Although various
modeling approaches exist, including UML (Unified Modeling Language) in
software engineering and its dialect, SysML (System Modeling Language), in
systems engineering, several difficulties arise in such models, including the
problem of model multiplicity that is related to the lack an integrated view of
structure and behavior. This paper generalizes conceptual modeling to be
applied in organizations at large. According to authorities, the so-called
organization theory portrays organizations as machine-like systems. As a
machine, an organization coordinates its parts to transform inputs into
outputs. Therefore, we synthesize the notion of an organization as a machine
and apply a new modeling methodology called thinging machine (TM) to real
engineering operations. The results show the viability of the TM methodology
serving as a foundation for high-level modelling of systems.

As the Carnot engine has essentially contributed to the equilibrium

the challenge of constructing nonequilibrium thermodynamics. However, the high
complexity of the engine involving an intricate coupling among heat, gas flow,
and mechanics has prevented simple modeling. Here, we experimentally
characterized the nonequilibrium dynamics and thermodynamics of a
low-temperature-differential Stirling engine, which is a model autonomous heat
engine. Our experiments demonstrated that the core engine dynamics are
quantitatively described by a minimal dynamical model with only two degrees of

116,"  Binary reverse engineering is a challenging task because it often
necessitates reasoning using both domain-specific knowledge (e.g.,
understanding entrypoint idioms common to an ABI) and logical inference (e.g.,
reconstructing interprocedural control flow). To help perform these tasks,
reverse engineers often use toolkits (such as IDA Pro or Ghidra) that allow
them to interactively explicate properties of binaries. We argue that deductive
databases serve as a natural abstraction for interfacing between
visualization-based binary analysis tools and high-performance logical
inference engines that compute facts about binaries. In this paper, we present
a vision for the future in which reverse engineers use a visualization-based
tool to understand binaries while simultaneously querying a logical-inference
engine to perform arbitrarily-complex deductive inference tasks. We call our
vision declarative demand-driven reverse engineering (D^3RE for short), and
sketch a formal semantics whose goal is to mediate interaction between a
logical-inference engine (such Souffle) and a reverse engineering tool. We
describe aprototype tool, d3re, which are using to explore the D^3RE vision.
While still a prototype, we have used d3re to reimplement several common
querying tasks on binaries. Our evaluation demonstrates that d3re enables both
better performance and more succinct implementation of these common RE tasks.

117,"  Given the data-intensive and collaborative trend in science, the software
engineering community also pays increasing attention to obtaining valuable and
useful insights from data repositories. Nevertheless, applying data science to
software engineering (e.g., mining software repositories) can be blindfold and
meaningless, if lacking a suitable knowledge architecture (KA). By observing
that software engineering practices are generally recorded through a set of
factors (e.g., programmer capacity, different environmental conditions, etc.)
involved in various software project aspects, we propose a factor-based
hierarchical KA of software engineering to help maximize the value of software
repositories and inspire future software data-driven studies. In particular, it
is the organized factors and their relationships that help guide software
engineering knowledge mining, while the mined knowledge will in turn be
indexed/managed through the relevant factors and their interactions. This paper
explains our idea about the factorial KA and concisely demonstrates a KA

120,"  Search engines can be considered as a gate to the world of WEB, and they also
decide what we see for a given search query. Since many people are exposed to
information through search engines, it is fair to expect that search engines
should be neutral; i.e. the returned results must cover all the elements or
aspects of the search topic, and they should be impartial where the results are
returned based on relevance. However, the search engine results are based on
many features and sophisticated algorithms where search neutrality is not
necessarily the focal point. In this work we performed an empirical study on
two popular search engines and analysed the search engine result pages for
controversial topics such as abortion, medical marijuana, and gay marriage. Our
analysis is based on the sentiment in search results to identify their
viewpoint as conservative or liberal. We also propose three sentiment-based
metrics to show the existence of bias as well as to compare viewpoints of the
two search engines. Extensive experiments performed on controversial topics
show that both search engines are biased, moreover they have the same kind of

discuss their important distinctions as well as the advantage of using the
two-qubit engine. In particular, the two-qubit engine offers an interesting
study of the interplay between the degree of squeezing and that of the
coherence between the two qubits. We find that the two-qubit engine generally
yields higher power than its one-qubit counterpart. The effective temperature
of the squeezed baths can be calculated both for the one and two-qubit engines,
and they tend to show an exponential growth with increase in squeezing
parameters $r_h$ and $r_c$. It is also observed that by tuning the squeezing
parameters, the machine can be made to work either in the engine or in the

123,"  In this third decade of systems engineering in the twenty-first century, it
is important to develop and demonstrate practical methods to exploit
machine-readable models in the engineering of systems. Substantial investment
has been made in languages and modelling tools for developing models. A key
problem is that system architects and engineers work in a multidisciplinary
environment in which models are not the product of any one individual. This
paper provides preliminary results of a formal approach to specify models and
structure preserving transformations between them that support model
synchronization. This is an important area of research and practice in software
engineering. However, it is limited to synchronization at the code level of
systems. This paper leverages previous research of the authors to define a core
fractal for interpretation of concepts into model specifications and
transformation between models. This fractal is used to extend the concept of
synchronization of models to the system level and is demonstrated through a
practical engineering example for an advanced driver assistance system.

124,"  We study the optimal performance of an endoreversible quantum dot heat
engine, in which the heat transfer between the system and baths is mediated by
qubits, operating under the conditions of a trade-off objective function known
as maximum efficient power function defined by the product of power and
efficiency of the engine. First, we numerically study the optimization of the
efficient power function for the engine under consideration. Then, we obtain
some analytic results by applying hightemperature limit and compare the
performance of the engine at maximum efficient power functionto the engine
operating in the maximum power regime. We find that the engine operating at
maximum efficient power function produces at least 88.89% of the maximum power
output while at the same time reduces the power loss due to entropy production
by considerable amount. We conclude by studying the stochastic simulations of
the efficiency of the engine in maximum power and maximum efficient power
regime. We find that the engine operating at maximum power is subjected to less
power fluctuations as compared to the on one operating at maximum efficient
power function.

127,"  Engineering processes for safety-critical systems describe the steps and
sequence that guide engineers from refining user requirements into executable
code, as well as producing the artifacts, traces, and evidence that the
resulting system is of high quality. Process compliance focuses on ensuring
that the actual engineering work is followed as closely as possible to the
described engineering processes. To this end, temporal constraints describe the
ideal sequence of steps. Checking these process constraints, however, is still
a daunting task that requires a lot of manual work and delivers feedback to
engineers only late in the process. In this paper, we present an automated
constraint checking approach that can incrementally check temporal constraints
across inter-related engineering artifacts upon every artifact change thereby
enabling timely feedback to engineers on process deviations. Temporal
constraints are expressed in the Object Constraint Language (OCL) extended with
operators from Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). We demonstrate the ability of our
approach to support a wide range of higher level temporal patterns. We further
show that for constraints in an industry-derived use case, the average
evaluation time for a single constraint takes around 0.2 milliseconds.

education in engineering schools, particularly within the EE/CS sector. While
most engineering disciplines have historically aligned themselves with the
demands of the technology industry, the lack of critical examination of
industry practices and their impact on justice, equality, and sustainability is
self-evident. Today, the for-profit engineering/technology companies, some of
which are among the largest in the world, also shape the narrative of
engineering education and research in universities. As engineering graduates
form the largest cohorts within STEM disciplines in Western countries, they
become future professionals who will work, lead, or even establish companies in
this industry. Unfortunately, the curriculum within engineering education often
lacks a deep understanding of social realities, an essential component of a
comprehensive university education. Here we establish this unusual connection
with the industry that has driven engineering higher education for several
decades and its obvious negative impacts to society. We analyse this nexus and
highlight the need for engineering schools to hold a more critical viewpoint.

132,"  Game engines are tools to facilitate video game development. They provide
graphics, sound, and physics simulation features, which would have to be
otherwise implemented by developers. Even though essential for modern
commercial video game development, game engines are complex and developers
often struggle to understand their architecture, leading to maintainability and
evolution issues that negatively affect video game productions. In this paper,
we present the Subsystem-Dependency Recovery Approach (SyDRA), which helps game
engine developers understand game engine architecture and therefore make
informed game engine development choices. By applying this approach to 10
open-source game engines, we obtain architectural models that can be used to
compare game engine architectures and identify and solve issues of excessive
coupling and folder nesting. Through a controlled experiment, we show that the
inspection of the architectural models derived from SyDRA enables developers to
complete tasks related to architectural understanding and impact analysis in
less time and with higher correctness than without these models.

of the future state of aero-engines, so as to diagnose faults in advance.
Traditional aero-engine parameter prediction methods mainly use the nonlinear
mapping relationship of time series data but generally ignore the adequate
spatiotemporal features contained in aero-engine data. To this end, we propose
a brain-inspired spike echo state network (Spike-ESN) model for aero-engine
intelligent fault prediction, which is used to effectively capture the
evolution process of aero-engine time series data in the framework of
spatiotemporal dynamics. In the proposed approach, we design a spike input
layer based on Poisson distribution inspired by the spike neural encoding
mechanism of biological neurons, which can extract the useful temporal
characteristics in aero-engine sequence data. Then, the temporal
characteristics are input into a spike reservoir through the current
calculation method of spike accumulation in neurons, which projects the data
into a high-dimensional sparse space. In addition, we use the ridge regression
method to read out the internal state of the spike reservoir. Finally, the
experimental results of aero-engine states prediction demonstrate the
superiority and potential of the proposed method.

138,"  A heat engine is a machine which uses the temperature difference between a
hot and a cold reservoir to extract work. Here both reservoirs are quantum
systems and a heat engine is described by a unitary transformation which
decreases the average energy of the bipartite system. On the molecular scale,
the ability of implementing such a unitary heat engine is closely connected to
the ability of performing logical operations and classical computing. This is
shown by several examples:
  (1) The most elementary heat engine is a SWAP-gate acting on 1 hot and 1 cold
two-level systems with different energy gaps.
  (2) An optimal unitary heat engine on a pair of 3-level systems can directly
implement OR and NOT gates, as well as copy operations. The ability to
implement this heat engine on each pair of 3-level systems taken from the hot
and the cold ensemble therefore allows universal classical computation.
  (3) Optimal heat engines operating on one hot and one cold oscillator mode
with different frequencies are able to calculate polynomials and roots
approximately.
  (4) An optimal heat engine acting on 1 hot and n cold 2-level systems with
different level spacings can even solve the NP-complete problem KNAPSACK.
Whereas it is already known that the determination of ground states of
interacting many-particle systems is NP-hard, the optimal heat engine is a
thermodynamic problem which is NP-hard even for n non-interacting spin systems.
This result suggest that there may be complexity-theoretic limitations on the

139,"  Aiming to study GRB engine duration, we present numerical simulations to
investigate collapsar jets. We consider typical explosion energy ($10^{52}$
erg) but different engine durations, in the widest domain to date from 0.1 to
100 s. We employ an AMR 2D hydrodynamical code. Our results show that engine
duration strongly influences jet nature. We show that the efficiency of
launching and collimating relativistic outflow increases with engine duration,
until the intermediate engine range where it is the highest, past this point to
long engine range, the trend is slightly reversed; we call this point where
acceleration and collimation are the highest ""sweet spot"" ($\sim$10 -- 30 s).
Moreover, jet energy flux shows that variability is also high in this duration
domain. We argue that not all engine durations can produce the collimated,
relativistic and variable long GRB-jets. Considering a typical progenitor and
engine energy, we conclude that the ideal engine duration to reproduce a long
GRB is $\sim$10 -- 30 s, where the launch of relativistic, collimated and
variable jets is favored. We note that this duration domain makes a good link
with Lazzati et al. (2013), which suggested that the bulk of BATSE's long GRBs

142,"  Typically, search engines provide query suggestions to assist users in the
search process. Query suggestions are very important for improving users search
experience. However, most query suggestions are based on the user's search
logs, and they can be influenced by infrequently searched queries. Depending on
the user's query, query suggestions can be ineffective in global search engines
but effective in a domestic search engine. Conversely, it can be effective in
global engines and weak in domestic engines. In addition, log-based query
suggestions require many search logs, which makes them difficult to construct
outside of a large search engine. Some search engines do not provide query
suggestions, making searches difficult for users. These query suggestion
vulnerabilities degrade the user's search experience. In this study, we develop
a meta-suggestion, a new query suggestion scheme. Similar to meta-searches,
meta-suggestions retrieves candidate queries of suggestions from other search
engines. Meta-suggestions generate suggestions by reranking the aggregated
candidate queries. We develop a meta-suggestion engine (MSE) browser extension
that generates meta-suggestions. It can provide query suggestions for any
webpage and does not require a search log. Comparing our meta-suggestions to
major search engines such as Google, showed a 17% performance improvement on
normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) and a 31% improvement on
precision. If more detailed factors, such as user preferences are discovered
through continued research, it is expected that user searches will greatly
improve. An enhanced user search experience is possible if factors, such as
user preference, are examined in future work.

144,"  Context. JavaScript is a popular programming language today with several
implementations competing for market dominance. Although a specification
document and a conformance test suite exist to guide engine development, bugs
occur and have important practical consequences. Implementing correct engines
is challenging because the spec is intentionally incomplete and evolves
frequently. Objective. This paper investigates the use of test transplantation
and differential testing for revealing functional bugs in JavaScript engines.
The former technique runs the regression test suite of a given engine on
another engine. The latter technique fuzzes existing inputs and then compares
the output produced by different engines with a differential oracle. Method. We
conducted experiments with engines from five major players-Apple, Facebook,
Google, Microsoft, and Mozilla-to assess the effectiveness of test
transplantation and differential testing. Results. Our results indicate that
both techniques revealed several bugs, many of which confirmed by developers.
We reported 35 bugs with test transplantation (23 of these bugs confirmed and
19 fixed) and reported 24 bugs with differential testing (17 of these confirmed
and 10 fixed). Results indicate that most of these bugs affected two
engines-Apple's JSC and Microsoft's ChakraCore (24 and 26 bugs, respectively).
To summarize, our results show that test transplantation and differential
testing are easy to apply and very effective in finding bugs in complex
software, such as JavaScript engines.

145,"  For improving flexibility and robustness of the engineering of automated
production systems (aPS) in case of extending, reducing or modifying parts,
several approaches propose an encapsulation and clustering of related
functions, e.g. from the electrical, mechanical or software engineering, based
on a modular architecture. Considering the development of these modules, there
are different stages, e.g. module planning or functional engineering, which
have to be completed. A reference model that addresses the different stages for
the engineering of aPS is proposed by AutomationML. Due to these different
stages and the integration of several engineering disciplines, e.g. mechanical,
electrical/electronic or software engineering, information not limited to one
discipline are stored redundantly increasing the effort to transfer information
and the risk of inconsistency. Although, data formats for the storage and
exchange of plant engineering information exist, e.g. AutomationML, fixed
domain specific structures and relations of the information, e.g. for automated
material flow systems (aMFS), are missing. This paper presents the integration
of a meta model into the development of modules for aMFS to improve the
transferability and consistency of information between the different
engineering stages and the increasing level of detail from the coarse-grained
plant planning to the fine-grained functional engineering.

146,"  Data-driven engineering refers to systematic data collection and processing
using machine learning to improve engineering systems. Currently, the
implementation of data-driven engineering relies on fundamental data science
and software engineering skills. At the same time, model-based engineering is
gaining relevance for the engineering of complex systems. In previous work, a
model-based engineering approach integrating the formalization of machine
learning tasks using the general-purpose modeling language SysML is presented.
However, formalized machine learning tasks still require the implementation in
a specialized programming languages like Python. Therefore, this work aims to
facilitate the implementation of data-driven engineering in practice by
extending the previous work of formalizing machine learning tasks by
integrating model transformation to generate executable code. The method
focuses on the modifiability and maintainability of the model transformation so
that extensions and changes to the code generation can be integrated without
requiring modifications to the code generator. The presented method is
evaluated for feasibility in a case study to predict weather forecasts. Based
thereon, quality attributes of model transformations are assessed and
discussed. Results demonstrate the flexibility and the simplicity of the method
reducing efforts for implementation. Further, the work builds a theoretical
basis for standardizing data-driven engineering implementation in practice.

147,"  Knowledge engineering is the process of creating and maintaining
knowledge-producing systems. Throughout the history of computer science and AI,
knowledge engineering workflows have been widely used given the importance of
high-quality knowledge for reliable intelligent agents. Meanwhile, the scope of
knowledge engineering, as apparent from its target tasks and use cases, has
been shifting, together with its paradigms such as expert systems, semantic
web, and language modeling. The intended use cases and supported user
requirements between these paradigms have not been analyzed globally, as new
paradigms often satisfy prior pain points while possibly introducing new ones.
The recent abstraction of systemic patterns into a boxology provides an opening
for aligning the requirements and use cases of knowledge engineering with the
systems, components, and software that can satisfy them best. This paper
proposes a vision of harmonizing the best practices in the field of knowledge
engineering by leveraging the software engineering methodology of creating
reference architectures. We describe how a reference architecture can be
iteratively designed and implemented to associate user needs with recurring
systemic patterns, building on top of existing knowledge engineering workflows
and boxologies. We provide a six-step roadmap that can enable the development
of such an architecture, providing an initial design and outcome of the
definition of architectural scope, selection of information sources, and
analysis. We expect that following through on this vision will lead to
well-grounded reference architectures for knowledge engineering, will advance
the ongoing initiatives of organizing the neurosymbolic knowledge engineering
space, and will build new links to the software architectures and data science
communities.

148,"  Regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) is an asymmetric cyberattack
that has become prominent in recent years. This attack exploits the slow
worst-case matching time of regular expression (regex) engines. In the past,
problematic regular expressions have led to outages at Cloudflare and Stack
Overflow, showing the severity of the problem. While ReDoS has drawn
significant research attention, there has been no systematization of knowledge
to delineate the state of the art and identify opportunities for further
research.
  In this paper, we describe the existing knowledge on ReDoS. We first provide
a systematic literature review, dividing works into two classes: measurement
studies and defenses. Then, our engineering review surveys the latest regex
engines to examine whether and how ReDoS defenses have been realized. Combining
our findings, we observe that (1) in the literature, almost no studies evaluate
whether and how ReDoS vulnerabilities can be weaponized against real systems,
making it difficult to assess their real-world impact; and (2) from an
engineering view, many mainstream regex engines now have ReDoS defenses,
rendering many threat models obsolete. The open challenges in ReDoS research
are to evaluate the emerging defenses, and to support engineers in migrating to
defended engines. To support these directions, we conclude by presenting the
wrk-redos tool. This tool supports controlled measurements of ReDoS on a web
service, and includes proof-of-concept Docker images that allow engineers to
substitute different regex engines in their applications.

results in an intuitive manner by focusing a query on a particular geographic
region. Geographic search technology, also called location search, has recently
received significant interest from major search engine companies. Academic
research in this area has focused primarily on techniques for extracting
geographic knowledge from the web. In this paper, we study the problem of
efficient query processing in scalable geographic search engines. Query
processing is a major bottleneck in standard web search engines, and the main
reason for the thousands of machines used by the major engines. Geographic

152,"  The requirements roadmap concept is introduced as a solution to the problem
of the requirements engineering of adaptive systems. The concept requires a new
general definition of the requirements problem which allows for quantitative
(numeric) variables, together with qualitative (binary boolean) propositional
variables, and distinguishes monitored from controlled variables for use in
control loops. We study the consequences of these changes, and argue that the
requirements roadmap concept bridges the gap between current general
definitions of the requirements problem and its notion of solution, and the
research into the relaxation of requirements, the evaluation of their partial
satisfaction, and the monitoring and control of requirements, all topics of
particular interest in the engineering of requirements for adaptive systems
[Cheng et al. 2009]. From the theoretical perspective, we show clearly and
formally the fundamental differences between more traditional conception of
requirements engineering (e.g., Zave & Jackson [1997]) and the requirements
engineering of adaptive systems (from Fickas & Feather [1995], over Letier &

  Practical implications - Searchers should not use the language restriction in
Google and MSN when searching for foreign-language documents. Instead,
searchers should use Yahoo or Ask. If searching for foreign language documents
in Google or MSN, the interface in the target language/country should be used.

161,"  The triumph of heat engines is their ability to convert the disordered energy
of thermal sources into useful mechanical motion. In recent years, much effort
has been devoted to generalizing thermodynamic notions to the quantum regime,
partly motivated by the promise of surpassing classical heat engines. Here, we
instead adopt a bottom-up approach: we propose a realistic autonomous heat
engine that can serve as a testbed for quantum effects in the context of
thermodynamics. Our model draws inspiration from actual piston engines and is
built from closed-system Hamiltonians and weak bath coupling terms. We
analytically derive the performance of the engine in the classical regime via a
set of nonlinear Langevin equations. In the quantum case, we perform numerical
simulations of the master equation. Finally, we perform a dynamic and
thermodynamic analysis of the engine's behaviour for several parameter regimes
in both the classical and quantum case, and find that the latter exhibits a
consistently lower efficiency due to additional noise.
","The victory of a thermal engine is the ability to switch between disordered energy.
Recently, there is a source of useful mechanical exercise.

generated in a strained graphene monolayer doped with a magnetic impurity. We
observe remarkably large efficiency and large thermoelectric figure of merit
both for the charge as well as spin variants of the quantum heat engine. This
suggests the use of this device as a highly efficient quantum heat engine for
charge as well as spin-based transport. Further, a comparison is drawn between
the device characteristics of a graphene spin heat engine against a quantum
spin Hall heat engine. The reason being edge modes because of their origin
should give much better performance. In this respect, we observe our
graphene-based spin heat engine can almost match the performance
characteristics of a quantum spin Hall heat engine. Finally, we show that a

163,"  The development of self-adaptive software requires the engineering of an
adaptation engine that controls the underlying adaptable software by feedback
loops. The engine often describes the adaptation by runtime models representing
the adaptable software and by activities such as analysis and planning that use
these models. To systematically address the interplay between runtime models
and adaptation activities, runtime megamodels have been proposed. A runtime
megamodel is a specific model capturing runtime models and adaptation
activities. In this article, we go one step further and present an executable
modeling language for ExecUtable RuntimE MegAmodels (EUREMA) that eases the
development of adaptation engines by following a model-driven engineering
approach. We provide a domain-specific modeling language and a runtime
interpreter for adaptation engines, in particular feedback loops. Megamodels
are kept alive at runtime and by interpreting them, they are directly executed
to run feedback loops. Additionally, they can be dynamically adjusted to adapt
feedback loops. Thus, EUREMA supports development by making feedback loops
explicit at a higher level of abstraction and it enables solutions where
multiple feedback loops interact or operate on top of each other and
self-adaptation co-exists with offline adaptation for evolution.
","Developing your own adaptive software requires engineering.
Applicable engine to control software that can be adapted by feedback
Loops and engines often explain the adaptation of each runtime model that is often expressed.
By activities such as adaptable software, analysis, and planned plans
It systematically solves the interaction between this model and the runtime model.

business maturity model of software product line, which is a methodology to
evaluate the current maturity of the business dimension of a software product
line in an organization. This model examines the coordination between product

167,"  The condition for stationary engines to attain the Carnot efficiency in and
beyond the linear response regime is investigated. We find that this condition
for finite-size engines is significantly different from that for macroscopic
engines in the thermodynamic limit. For the case of finite-size engines, the
tight-coupling condition in the linear response regime directly implies the
attainability of the Carnot efficiency beyond the linear response regime.
Contrary to this, for the case of macroscopic engines in the thermodynamic
limit, there are three types of mechanisms to attain the Carnot efficiency. One
mechanism allows engines to attain the Carnot efficiency only in the linear
response limit, while other two mechanisms enable engines to attain the Carnot
efficiency beyond the linear response regime. These three mechanisms are
classified by introducing tight-coupling window.

170,"  Legacy software systems typically include vital data for organizations that
use them and should thus to be regularly maintained. Ideally, organizations
should rely on Requirements Engineers to understand and manage changes of
stakeholder needs and system constraints. However, due to time and cost
pressure, and with a heavy focus on implementation, organizations often choose
to forgo Requirements Engineers and rather focus on ad-hoc bug fixing and
maintenance. This position paper discusses what Requirements Engineers could
possibly learn from other similar roles to become crucial for the evolution of
legacy systems. Particularly, we compare the roles of Requirements Engineers
(according to IREB), Building Architects (according to the German regulations),
and Product Owners (according to ""The Scrum-Guide""). We discuss overlaps along
four dimensions: liability, self-portrayal, core activities, and artifacts.
Finally we draw insights from these related fields to foster the concept of a

171,"  Finding a good query plan is key to the optimization of query runtime. This
holds in particular for cost-based federation engines, which make use of
cardinality estimations to achieve this goal. A number of studies compare
SPARQL federation engines across different performance metrics, including query
runtime, result set completeness and correctness, number of sources selected
and number of requests sent. Albeit informative, these metrics are generic and
unable to quantify and evaluate the accuracy of the cardinality estimators of
cost-based federation engines. To thoroughly evaluate cost-based federation
engines, the effect of estimated cardinality errors on the overall query
runtime performance must be measured. In this paper, we address this challenge
by presenting novel evaluation metrics targeted at a fine-grained benchmarking
of cost-based federated SPARQL query engines. We evaluate five cost-based
federated SPARQL query engines using existing as well as novel evaluation
metrics by using LargeRDFBench queries. Our results provide a detailed analysis
of the experimental outcomes that reveal novel insights, useful for the

for a sample of keywords, and define for each keyword the visibility of a page
based on its ranking over all search engines. This allows to define a score of
the search engine for a keyword, and then its average score over all keywords.
Based on the pages visibility, we can also define the consensus search engine

174,"  In this paper, a novel mean-value exergy-based modeling framework for
internal combustion engines is developed. The characterization of combustion
irreversibilities, thermal exchange between the in-cylinder mixture and the
cylinder wall, and non-stoichiometric combustion allows for a comprehensive
description of the availability transfer and destruction phenomena in the
engine. The model is applicable to internal combustion engines operating both
in steady-state and over a sequence of operating points and can be used to
characterize the whole engine operating region, allowing to create static maps
describing the exergetic behavior of the engine as a function of speed and
load. The application of the proposed modeling strategy is shown for a
turbocharged diesel engine. Ultimately, the static maps, while providing
insightful information about inefficiencies over the whole operating field of
the engine, are the enabling step for the development of exergy-based control
strategies aiming at minimizing the overall operational losses of ground
vehicles.

engineering research. In contrast to many other scientific disciplines,
however, explicit support for this key activity in software engineering is
relatively small. While some approaches to improve this situation have been
proposed by the software engineering community, experiments are still very
difficult and sometimes impossible to replicate. In this paper, we propose the
concept of an experimentation workbench as a means of explicit support for
experimentation in software engineering research. In particular, we discuss
core requirements that an experimentation workbench should satisfy in order to
qualify as such and to offer a real benefit for researchers. Beyond their core
benefits for experimentation, we stipulate that experimentation workbenches
will also have benefits in regard to reproducibility and repeatability of

a separate language processing engine to give the system better performance. In
this paper, we discuss ways in which the speech recognition engine and the

180,"  Current day software development relies heavily on the use of service
architectures and on agile iterative development methods to design, implement,
and deploy systems. These practices result in systems made up of multiple
services that introduce new data flows and evolving designs that escape the
control of a single designer. Academic privacy engineering literature typically
abstracts away such conditions of software production in order to achieve
generalizable results. Yet, through a systematic study of the literature, we
show that proposed solutions inevitably make assumptions about software
architectures, development methods and scope of designer control that are
misaligned with current practices. These misalignments are likely to pose an
obstacle to operationalizing privacy engineering solutions in the wild.
Specifically, we identify important limitations in the approaches that

181,"  Colloidal heat engines are paradigmatic models to understand the conversion
of heat into work in a noisy environment - a domain where biological and
synthetic nano/micro machines function. While the operation of these engines
across thermal baths is well-understood, how they function across baths with
noise statistics that is non-Gaussian and also lacks memory, the simplest
departure from equilibrium, remains unclear. Here we quantified the performance
of a colloidal Stirling engine operating between an engineered
\textit{memoryless} non-Gaussian bath and a Gaussian one. In the quasistatic
limit, the non-Gaussian engine functioned like an equilibrium one as predicted
by theory. On increasing the operating speed, due to the nature of noise
statistics, the onset of irreversibility for the non-Gaussian engine preceded
its thermal counterpart and thus shifted the operating speed at which power is
maximum. The performance of nano/micro machines can be tuned by altering only
the nature of reservoir noise statistics.

automated geometry cleaning and meshing, while categorical labels and
structural simulations facilitate classification and regression (i.e.
engineering surrogate modeling). In contrast to existing shape collections,
SimJEB's models are all designed for the same engineering function and thus
have consistent structural loads and support conditions. On the other hand,
SimJEB models are more complex, diverse, and realistic than the synthetically
generated datasets commonly used in parametric surrogate model evaluation. The
designs in SimJEB were derived from submissions to the GrabCAD Jet Engine
Bracket Challenge: an open engineering design competition with over 700
hand-designed CAD entries from 320 designers representing 56 countries. Each

183,"  Abstract The Curzon-Ahlborn (CA) efficiency, as the efficiency at the maximum
power (EMP) of the endoreversible Carnot engine, has a significant impact on
finite-time thermodynamics. However, the CA engine model is based on many
assumptions. In the past few decades, although a lot of efforts have been made,
a microscopic theory of the CA engine is still lacking. By adopting the method
of the stochastic differential equation of energy, we formulate a microscopic
theory of the CA engine realized with an underdamped Brownian particle in a
class of non-harmonic potentials. This theory gives microscopic interpretation
of all assumptions made by Curzon and Ahlborn, and thus puts the results about
CA engine on a solid foundation. Also, based on this theory, we obtain
analytical expressions of the power and the efficiency statistics for the
Brownian CA engine. Our research brings new perspectives to experimental
studies of finite-time microscopic heat engines featured with fluctuations.

184,"  Quantum computing (QC) represents the future of computing systems, but the
tools for reasoning about the quantum model of computation, in which the laws
obeyed are those on the quantum mechanical scale, are still a mix of linear
algebra and Dirac notation; two subjects more suitable for physicists, rather
than computer scientists and software engineers. On this ground, we believe it
is possible to provide a more intuitive approach to thinking and writing about
quantum computing systems, in order to simplify the design of quantum
algorithms and the development of quantum software. In this paper, we move the
first step in such direction, introducing a specification language as the tool
to represent the operations of a quantum computer via axiomatic definitions, by
adopting the same symbolisms and reasoning principles used by formal methods in
software engineering. We name this approach formal quantum software engineering
(F-QSE). This work assumes familiarity with the basic principles of quantum

engineering (SE), and with the notation and techniques of first-order logic

can effectively reduce complications. The aim of studying tissue engineering
technology is to find sperm cells and suitable biological materials to replace
the original biological functions of tissues and to establish a suitable in

187,"  As software engineering research becomes more concerned with the
psychological, sociological and managerial aspects of software development,
relevant theories from reference disciplines are increasingly important for
understanding the field's core phenomena of interest. However, the degree to
which software engineering research draws on relevant social sciences remains
unclear. This study therefore investigates the use of social science theories
in five influential software engineering journals over 13 years. It analyzes
not only the extent of theory use but also what, how and where these theories
are used. While 87 different theories are used, less than two percent of papers
use a social science theory, most theories are used in only one paper, most
social sciences are ignored, and the theories are rarely tested for
applicability to software engineering contexts. Ignoring relevant social
science theories may (1) undermine the community's ability to generate,
elaborate and maintain a cumulative body of knowledge; and (2) lead to
oversimplified models of software engineering phenomena. More attention to
theory is needed for software engineering to mature as a scientific discipline.

188,"  Brownian information engines can extract work from thermal fluctuations by
utilizing information. So far, the studies on Brownian information engines
consider the system in a thermal bath; however, many processes in nature occur
in a nonequilibrium setting, such as the suspensions of self-propelled
microorganisms or cellular environments called an active bath. Here, we
introduce an archetypal model for Maxwell-demon type cyclic Brownian
information engine operating in a Gaussian correlated active bath. The active
engine can extract more work than its thermal counterpart, exceeding the bound
set by the second law of information thermodynamics. We obtain a general
integral fluctuation theorem for the active engine that includes additional
mutual information gained from the active bath with a unique effective
temperature. This effective description modifies the second law and provides a
new upper bound for the extracted work. Unlike the passive information engine
operating in a thermal bath, the active information engine extracts colossal
power that peaks at the finite cycle period. Our study provides fundamental
insights into the design and functioning of synthetic and biological submicron
motors in active baths under measurement and feedback control.

post-secondary diploma in Software Engineering, Computer Science, or a related

career, starting from other industries or fields of study. This paper proposes
a study on barriers faced by software engineers with non-traditional
educational and occupational backgrounds, and possible mitigation strategies
for those barriers. We propose a two-stage methodology, consisting of an
exploratory study, followed by a validation study. The exploratory study will
involve a grounded-theory-based qualitative analysis of relevant Reddit data to
yield a framework around the barriers and possible mitigation strategies. These
findings will then be validated using a survey in the validation study. Making
software engineering more accessible to those with non-traditional backgrounds
will not only bring about the benefits of functional diversity, but also serves
as a method of filling in the labour shortages of the software engineering

190,"  Video game developers use game engines as a tool to manage complex aspects of
game development. While engines play a big role in the success of games, to the
best of our knowledge, they are often developed in isolation, in a
closed-source manner, without architectural discussions, comparison, and
collaboration among projects. In this work in progress, we compare the call
graphs of two open-source engines: Godot 3.4.4 and Urho3D 1.8. While static
analysis tools could provide us with a general picture without precise call
graph paths, the use of a profiler such as Callgrind allows us to also view the
call order and frequency. These graphs give us insight into the engines'
designs. We showed that, by using Callgrind, we can obtain a high-level view of
an engine's architecture, which can be used to understand it. In future work,
we intend to apply both dynamic and static analysis to other open-source
engines to understand architectural patterns and their impact on aspects such

191,"  Driving a quantum system across quantum critical points leads to
non-adiabatic excitations in the system. This in turn may adversely affect the
functioning of a quantum machine which uses a quantum critical substance as its
working medium. Here we propose a bath-engineered quantum engine (BEQE), in
which we use the Kibble--Zurek mechanism and critical scaling laws to formulate
a protocol for enhancing the performance of finite-time quantum engines
operating close to quantum phase transitions. In the case of free fermionic
systems, BEQE enables finite-time engines to outperform engines operating in
the presence of shortcuts to adiabaticity, and even infinite-time engines under
suitable conditions, thus showing the remarkable advantages offered by this
technique. Open questions remain regarding the use of BEQE based on
non-integrable models.

192,"  Dynamical phases are obtained for a quantum thermal engine, whose working
medium is a single harmonic oscillator. The dynamics of this engine is obtained
by using four steps where in two steps the time dependent frequency is
changing. In the other two steps, the thermal engine is coupled alternatively
to hot and cold heat baths. Similar dynamical phases are obtained in a quantum
thermal engine whose working medium is spin 1/2 system. The role of times
durations of such steps in the quantum engines for getting maximal efficiency
is analyzed. The dynamic of charge pumping in a quantum dot coupled to two
reservoirs is studied. The effects of many modulation parameters including
their fluctuations for getting geometric phases are analyzed. Since the
separate steps in thermal engines describe non-cyclic circuits, we propose to
use a special method for measuring geometric phases in thermal engines for
non-cyclic circuits which is gauge invariant.

193,"  We propose a thermodynamically consistent, analytically tractable model of
steady-state active heat engines driven by both temperature difference and a
constant chemical driving. While the engine follows the dynamics of the Active
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Particle, its self-propulsion stems from the mechanochemical
coupling with the fuel consumption dynamics, allowing for both even- and
odd-parity self-propulsion forces. Using the standard methods of stochastic
thermodynamics, we show that the entropy production of the engine satisfies the
conventional Clausius relation, based on which we define the efficiency of the
model that is bounded from above by the second law of thermodynamics. Using
this framework, we obtain exact expressions for the efficiency at maximum
power. The results show that the engine performance has a nonmonotonic
dependence on the magnitude of the chemical driving, and that the even-parity
(odd-parity) engines perform better when the size of the engine is smaller
(larger) than the persistence length of the active particle. We also discuss
the existence of a tighter upper bound on the efficiency of the odd-parity
engines stemming from the detailed structure of the entropy production.

194,"  Considerable attention has been devoted to microscopic heat engines in both
theoretical and experimental aspects. Notably, the fundamental limits
pertaining to power and efficiency, as well as the tradeoff relations between
these two quantities, have been intensively studied. This study aims to shed
further light on the ultimate limits of heat engines by exploring the
relationship between the geometric length along the path of cyclic heat engines
operating at arbitrary speeds and their power and efficiency. We establish a
tradeoff relation between power and efficiency using the geometric length and
the timescale of the heat engine. Remarkably, because the geometric quantity
comprises experimentally accessible terms in classical cases, this relation is
useful for the inference of thermodynamic efficiency. Moreover, we reveal that
the power of a heat engine is always upper bounded by the product of its
geometric length and the statistics of energy. Our results provide a geometric
characterization of the performance of cyclic heat engines, which is
universally applicable to both classical and quantum heat engines operating far
from equilibrium.

199,"  Finite-time quantum heat engines are of practical relevance as they can
generate finite-power, distinguishing them from ideal quasistatic engines
typically used for theoretical purposes. However, these engines encounter
energy losses due to quantum friction, which is particularly pronounced in
many-body systems with non-trivial coherences in their density operator.
Strategies such as shortcuts to adiabaticity and fast routes to thermalization
have been developed although the associated cost requirements remain uncertain.
In this study, we theoretically investigate the finite-time operation of a
trapped-atom Otto engine with light-induced dipole-dipole interactions and
projection measurements in one of the isochoric processes. The investigation
reveals that appropriate control of dipole-dipole interactions of the working
medium prompts engine operation upon interacting with the hot reservoir, while
projection measurements and adjustment of the unitary driving protocols
effectively reduce quantum friction to enhance finite-time engine performance
compared to non-interacting and quasi-static counterparts. This setup presents
a compelling avenue for further investigation of finite-time many-body quantum
heat engines and provides an opportunity to explore the full potential of
photon-mediated dipole-dipole interactions in their operations.

202,"  The performance of large language models (LLMs) is significantly influenced
by the quality of the prompts provided. In response, researchers have developed
enormous prompt engineering strategies aimed at modifying the prompt text to
enhance task performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel technique termed
position engineering, which offers a more efficient way to guide large language
models. Unlike prompt engineering, which requires substantial effort to modify
the text provided to LLMs, position engineering merely involves altering the
positional information in the prompt without modifying the text itself. We have
evaluated position engineering in two widely-used LLM scenarios:
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and in-context learning (ICL). Our
findings show that position engineering substantially improves upon the
baseline in both cases. Position engineering thus represents a promising new
strategy for exploiting the capabilities of large language models.

203,"  A finite cycle time information engine based on a two-level system in contact
with a thermal reservoir is studied analytically. The model for the engine
incorporates an error in measuring the system's state and time delay between
the measurement and the feedback process. The efficiency and power of the
engine in steady state are derived as a function of level spacing, feedback
delay time, engine cycle time, and measurement error. For a fixed value of
level spacing and feedback delay, there is an upper bound on measurement error
such that the engine can extract positive work. This threshold value of error
is found to be independent of the cycle time. For a range of values of level
spacing and feedback delay time, efficiency has a non-monotonic dependence on
the measurement error, implying that there is an optimal measurement error for
the information engine to operate efficiently. At high temperatures and with
precise measurement, the engine's ability to extract positive work is extended
over a larger range of feedback delay time.

205,"  Performance of nano- and micro-scale heat engines can be improved with a help
from quantum mechanical phenomena. Recently, heat reservoirs with quantum
coherence have been proposed to enhance engine performance beyond the Carnot
limit even with a single reservoir. However, no physical realizations have been
achieved so far. Here, we report the first proof-of-principle experimental
demonstration of a photonic quantum engine driven by superradiance employing a
single heat reservoir composed of atoms and photonic vacuum. Reservoir atoms
prepared in a quantum coherent superposition state underwent superradiance
while traversing the cavity. This led to about 40-fold increase of the
effective engine temperature, resulting in a near-unity engine efficiency.
Moreover, the observed engine output power grew quadratically with respect to
the atomic injection rate. Our work can be utilized in quantum mechanical heat
transfer as well as in boosting engine powers, opening a pathway to development
of photomechanical devices that run on quantum coherence embedded in heat
baths.

206,"  Collisional Brownian engines have been proposed as alternatives for
nonequilibrium nanoscale engines. However, most studies have focused on the
simpler overdamped case, leaving the role of inertia much less explored. In
this work, we introduce the idea of collisional engines to underdamped Brownian
particles, where each stage is sequentially subjected to a distinct driving
force. A careful comparison between the performance of underdamped and
overdamped Brownian work-to-work engines has been undertaken. The results show
that underdamped Brownian engines generally outperform their overdamped
counterparts. A key difference is the presence of a resonant regime in
underdamped engines, in which both efficiency and power output are enhanced
across a broad set of parameters. Our study highlights the importance of
carefully selecting dynamics and driving protocols to achieve optimal engine
performance.

208,"  Organizations, particularly medium and large enterprises, typically today
rely heavily on complex, distributed systems to deliver critical services and
products. However, the growing complexity of these systems poses challenges in
ensuring service availability, performance, and reliability. Traditional
resilience testing methods often fail to capture modern systems' intricate
interactions and failure modes. Chaos Engineering addresses these challenges by
proactively testing how systems in production behave under turbulent
conditions, allowing developers to uncover and resolve potential issues before
they escalate into outages. Though chaos engineering has received growing
attention from researchers and practitioners alike, we observed a lack of a
comprehensive literature review. Hence, we performed a Multivocal Literature
Review (MLR) on chaos engineering to fill this research gap by systematically
analyzing 88 academic and grey literature sources published from January 2019
to April 2024. We first used the selected sources to derive a unified
definition of chaos engineering and to identify key capabilities, components,
and adoption drivers. We also developed a taxonomy for chaos engineering and
compared the relevant tools using it. Finally, we analyzed the state of the
current chaos engineering research and identified several open research issues.

209,"  Empirical software engineering research on production systems has brought
forth a better understanding of the software engineering process for
practitioners and researchers alike. However, only a small subset of production
systems is studied, limiting the impact of this research. While software
engineering practitioners could benefit from replicating research on their own
data, this poses its own set of challenges, since performing replications
requires a deep understanding of research methodologies and subtle nuances in
software engineering data. Given that large language models (LLMs), such as
GPT-4, show promise in tackling both software engineering- and science-related
tasks, these models could help replicate and thus democratize empirical
software engineering research.
  In this paper, we examine GPT-4's abilities to perform replications of
empirical software engineering research on new data. We study their ability to
surface assumptions made in empirical software engineering research
methodologies, as well as their ability to plan and generate code for analysis
pipelines on seven empirical software engineering papers. We perform a user
study with 14 participants with software engineering research expertise, who
evaluate GPT-4-generated assumptions and analysis plans (i.e., a list of module
specifications) from the papers. We find that GPT-4 is able to surface correct
assumptions, but struggles to generate ones that apply common knowledge about
software engineering data. In a manual analysis of the generated code, we find
that the GPT-4-generated code contains correct high-level logic, given a subset
of the methodology. However, the code contains many small implementation-level
errors, reflecting a lack of software engineering knowledge. Our findings have
implications for leveraging LLMs for software engineering research as well as
practitioner data scientists in software teams.

210,"  The conventional continuous quantum heat engines rely on incoherent heat
transfer with the baths and, thus, have limited capability to outperform their
classical counterparts. In this work, we introduce distinct continuous quantum
heat engines that utilize coherent heat transfer with baths, yielding
significant quantum enhancement in performance. These continuous engines,
termed as coherent engines, consist of one qutrit system and two photonic baths
and enable coherent heat transfer via two-photon transitions involving
three-body interactions between the system and hot and cold baths. The closest
quantum incoherent analogs are those that only allow incoherent heat transfer
between the qutrit and the baths via one-photon transitions relying on two-body
interactions between the system and hot or cold baths. We demonstrate that
coherent engines deliver much higher power output and a much lower
signal-to-noise ratio in power, where the latter signifies the reliability of
an engine, compared to incoherent engines. Coherent engines manifest more
non-classical features than incoherent engines because they violate the
classical thermodynamic uncertainty relation by a greater amount and for a
wider range of parameters. Importantly, coherent engines can operate close to
or at the fundamental lower limit on reliability given by the quantum version
of the thermodynamic uncertainty relation, making them highly reliable. These
genuine enhancements in performance by hundreds of folds over incoherent
engines and the saturation of the quantum limit by coherent engines are
directly attributed to its capacity to harness higher energetic coherence which
is, again, a consequence of coherent heat transfer. The experimental
feasibility of coherent engines and the improved understanding of how quantum
properties can enhance performance may find important implications in emerging
quantum technologies.

discussed. A general formula for the efficiency of such an engine with an
arbitrary confining potential is presented. Its expression is purely given in
terms of the structure of the energy spectrum. Dependency of the efficiency on
the form of a potential as an analog of the working material in thermodynamics
implies nonuniversality of the engine. This may be due to the absence of the

227,"  Based on quantum thermodynamic processes, we make a quantum-mechanical (QM)
extension of the typical heat engine cycles, such as the Carnot, Brayton, Otto,
and Diesel cycles, etc. The temperature is not included in these QM engine
cycles, as lies in the fact that the concept of energy is well-defined in
quantum mechanics, temperature \emph{a priori} is not. These QM engine cycles
are implemented by an ideal or interacting system with an arbitrary number of
particles confined in an arbitrary power-law trap. As a result, a relation
between the quantum adiabatic exponent and trap exponent is found. The
efficiency of a given QM engine cycle is similar to that of its classical
counterpart, thereby identifying the universality of the efficiency.

266,"  Heat engines cannot generally operate at maximum power and efficiency,
imposing a trade-off between the two. Here, we highlight the exact nature of
this trade-off for engines that exchange heat radiatively with a hot source. We
derive simple analytical expressions for the performance bounds of reciprocal
and nonreciprocal radiative heat engines. We also highlight that radiative
engines can achieve a better power-efficiency trade-off than linear ones. These
bounds are especially relevant for thermophotovoltaics, offering useful metrics
against which to compare device performance.

numerically evaluated the average work, power and efficiency. We compare our

271,"  Electrical heat engines driven by the Johnson-Nyquist noise of resistors are
introduced. They utilize Coulomb's law and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem
of statistical physics that is the reverse phenomenon of heat dissipation in a
resistor. No steams, gases, liquids, photons, combustion, phase transition, or
exhaust/pollution are present here. In these engines, instead of heat
reservoirs, cylinders, pistons and valves, resistors, capacitors and switches
are the building elements. For the best performance, a large number of parallel
engines must be integrated to run in a synchronized fashion and the
characteristic size of the elementary engine must be at the 10 nanometers
scale. At room temperature, in the most idealistic case, a two-dimensional
ensemble of engines of 25 nanometer characteristic size integrated on a 2.5x2.5
cm silicon wafer with 12 Celsius temperature difference between the warm-source
and the cold-sink would produce a specific power of about 0.4 Watt. Regular and
coherent (correlated-cylinder states) versions are shown and both of them can
work in either four-stroke or two-stroke modes. The coherent engines have
properties that correspond to coherent quantum heat engines without the
presence of quantum coherence. In the idealistic case, all these engines have
Carnot efficiency, which is the highest possible efficiency of any heat engine,

272,"  We present a unified perspective on nonequilibrium heat engines by
generalizing nonlinear irreversible thermodynamics. For tight-coupling heat
engines, a generic constitutive relation of nonlinear response accurate up to
the quadratic order is derived from the symmetry argument and the stall
condition. By applying this generic nonlinear constitutive relation to
finite-time thermodynamics, we obtain the necessary and sufficient condition
for the universality of efficiency at maximum power, which states that a
tight-coupling heat engine takes the universal efficiency at maximum power up
to the quadratic order if and only if either the engine symmetrically interacts
with two heat reservoirs or the elementary thermal energy flowing through the
engine matches the characteristic energy of the engine. As a result, we solve
the following paradox: On the one hand, the universal quadratic term in the
efficiency at maximum power for tight-coupling heat engines proved as a
consequence of symmetry [M. Esposito, K. Lindenberg, and C. Van den Broeck,

274,"  A hyperaccreting stellar-mass black hole has been proposed as the candidate
central engine of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The rich observations of GRBs by
\textit{Fermi} and \textit{Swift} make it possible to constrain the central
engine model by comparing the model predications against data. This paper is
dedicated to studying the temporal evolution of central engine parameters for
both prompt emission and afterglow phases. We consider two jet launching
mechanisms, i.e., $\nu\bar{\nu}$ annihilations and the Blandford-Znajek (BZ)
processe, and obtain analytical solutions to these two models. We then
investigate the black hole central engine parameters, such as the jet power,
the dimensionless entropy $\eta$, and the central engine parameter $\mu_0=\eta
(1+\sigma_0)$ (where $\sigma_0$ is the initial magnetization of the engine) at
the base of the jet. The black hole may be spun up by accretion, or spun down
by the BZ process, leaving imprints in GRB lightcurves. Usually, a BZ jet is
more powerful and is likely responsible for the late time central engine
activities. However, an initially non-spinning black hole central engine may
first launch a thermal ""fireball"" via neutrino annihilations, and then launch a
Poynting-flux-dominated jet via the BZ process. Multiple flares, giant bumps,
and plateaus in GRB afterglows can be well produced as the result of late time
accretion onto the black hole.

275,"  Information on the web is prodigious; searching relevant information is

web-page rank. Every search engine has their own algorithms based on certain

276,"  Traffic engineering has been used in IP and MPLS networks for a number of
years as a tool for making more efficient use of capacity by explicitly routing
traffic demands where there is available network capacity that would otherwise
be unused. Deployment of traffic engineering imposes an additional layer of
complexity to network design and operations, however, which has constrained its
adoption for capacity optimisation. The rise of Software Defined Networks has
renewed interest in the use of traffic engineering approaches leveraging
centralised network controllers for capacity optimisation. We argue that future
networks can realise the network optimisation benefits of traffic engineering
without incurring additional network complexity through closer coupling between
the network and the applications and services using the network. This can be
achieved through leveraging a network- and traffic-aware controller to directly
influence where applications and services site or locate service instances,
i.e. which implicitly impacts the paths that the applications or services
traffic demands take through the network. We call this technique Demand
Engineering. Demand Engineering has the additional benefit of providing an
admission control capability, i.e. which can provide an assurance that network
SLAs can be met. In this paper we describe the concept of Demand Engineering,
give examples of its use and present simulation results indicating its
potential benefits. We also compare demand engineering to traffic engineering.

277,"  In this paper, the dynamic couplings among different inputs and outputs of a
highly nonlinear spark ignition (SI) engine control problem during the cold
start phase are evaluated by using relative gain array (RGA) technique. First,
based on the experimental data, a multi-input multi-output model is developed
to represent the engine dynamics. Second, the coupling among different inputs
and outputs of the model is evaluated by using RGA technique in both open-loop
and closed-loop structures. The results show that although there is an internal
coupling within the engine dynamics in the open-loop framework, the closed-loop
engine controller can be designed using a decentralized structure without
significantly affecting the system performance. In the next step, based on a
nonlinear physics-based model of the engine, a set of single-input
single-output (SISO) adaptive second order discrete sliding mode controllers
(DSMC) are designed to drive the states of the engine model to their
pre-defined desired trajectories and minimize the tailpipe HC emission, under
modelling and implementation (data sampling and quantization) uncertainties.
The real-time test results on an actual engine control unit (ECU) show that the
proposed SISO adaptive second order DSMC provides accurate and fast tracking
performance for the highly nonlinear and internally coupled engine dynamics,
and can meet the HC emission limit by controlling the engine-out emissions and
exhaust catalytic converter efficiency.

278,"  Assisting users by suggesting completed queries as they type is a common
feature of search systems known as query auto-completion. A query
auto-completion engine may use prior signals and available information (e.g.,
user is anonymous, user has a history, user visited the site before the search
or not, etc.) in order to improve its recommendations. There are many possible
strategies for query auto-completion and a challenge is to design one optimal
engine that considers and uses all available information. When different
strategies are used to produce the suggestions, it becomes hard to rank these
heterogeneous suggestions. An alternative strategy could be to aggregate
several engines in order to enhance the diversity of recommendations by
combining the capacity of each engine to digest available information
differently, while keeping the simplicity of each engine. The main objective of
this research is therefore to find such mixture of query completion engines
that would beat any engine taken alone. We tackle this problem under the
bandits setting and evaluate four strategies to overcome this challenge.
Experiments conducted on three real datasets show that a mixture of engines can
outperform a single engine.

279,"  An engine producing a finite power at the ideal (Carnot) efficiency is a
dream engine, which is not prohibited by the thermodynamic second law. Some
years ago, a two-terminal heat engine with {\em asymmetric} Onsager
coefficients in the linear response regime was suggested by Benenti, Saito, and
Casati [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 106}, 230602 (2011)], as a prototypical system to
make such a dream come true with non-divergent system parameter values.
However, such a system has never been realized in spite of many trials. Here,
we introduce an exactly solvable two-terminal Brownian heat engine with the
asymmetric Onsager coefficients in the presence of a Lorenz (magnetic) force.
Nevertheless, we show that the dream engine regime cannot be accessible even
with the asymmetric Onsager coefficients, due to an instability keeping the
engine from reaching its steady state. This is consistent with recent trade-off
relations between the engine power and efficiency, where the (cyclic)
steady-state condition is implicitly presumed. We conclude that the
inaccessibility to the dream engine originates from the steady-state constraint
on the engine.

280,"  Accessing to required data on the internet is wide via search engines in the
last two decades owing to the huge amount of available data and the high rate
of new data is generating daily. Accordingly, search engines are encouraged to
make the most valuable existing data on the web searchable. Knowing how to
handle a large amount of data in each step of a search engines' procedure from
crawling to indexing and ranking is just one of the challenges that a
professional search engine should solve. Moreover, it should also have the best
practices in handling users' traffics, state-of-the-art natural language
processing tools, and should also address many other challenges on the edge of
science and technology. As a result, evaluating these systems is too
challenging due to the level of internal complexity they have, and is crucial
for finding the improvement path of the existing system. Therefore, an
evaluation procedure is a normal subsystem of a search engine that has the role
of building its roadmap. Recently, several countries have developed national
search engine programs to build an infrastructure to provide special services
based on their needs on the available data of their language on the web. This
research is conducted accordingly to enlighten the advancement path of two
Iranian national search engines: Yooz and Parsijoo in comparison with two

281,"  Low-temperature-differential (LTD) Stirling heat engines are able to operate
with a small temperature difference between low-temperature heat reservoirs
that exist in our daily lives, and thus they are considered to be an important
sustainable energy technology. The author recently proposed a nonlinear
dynamics model of an LTD kinematic Stirling heat engine to study the rotational
mechanism of the engine [Y. Izumida, EPL \textbf{121}, 50004 (2018)]. This
paper presents our study of the nonequilibrium thermodynamics analysis of this
engine model, where a load torque against which the engine does work is
introduced. We demonstrate that the engine's rotational state is in a
quasi-linear response regime where the thermodynamic fluxes show a linear
dependency on the thermodynamic forces. Significantly, it is found that the
response coefficients of the quasi-linear relations are symmetric, which is
similar to Onsager symmetry in linear irreversible thermodynamics. Based on
these relations, we formulate the maximum efficiency of the engine. We also
elucidate that the symmetry of the quasi-linear response coefficients emerges
by reflecting the (anti-)reciprocity of the Onsager kinetic coefficients
identified for the relaxation dynamics of the engine in the vicinity of an
equilibrium state. We expect that the present study paves the way for
developing nonequilibrium thermodynamics of autonomous heat engines described
as a nonlinear dynamical system.

282,"  Context: Advancements in machine learning (ML) lead to a shift from the
traditional view of software development, where algorithms are hard-coded by
humans, to ML systems materialized through learning from data. Therefore, we
need to revisit our ways of developing software systems and consider the
particularities required by these new types of systems. Objective: The purpose
of this study is to systematically identify, analyze, summarize, and synthesize
the current state of software engineering (SE) research for engineering ML
systems. Method: I performed a systematic literature review (SLR). I
systematically selected a pool of 141 studies from SE venues and then conducted
a quantitative and qualitative analysis using the data extracted from these
studies. Results: The non-deterministic nature of ML systems complicates all SE
aspects of engineering ML systems. Despite increasing interest from 2018
onwards, the results reveal that none of the SE aspects have a mature set of
tools and techniques. Testing is by far the most popular area among
researchers. Even for testing ML systems, engineers have only some tool
prototypes and solution proposals with weak experimental proof. Many of the
challenges of ML systems engineering were identified through surveys and
interviews. Researchers should conduct experiments and case studies, ideally in
industrial environments, to further understand these challenges and propose
solutions. Conclusion: The results may benefit (1) practitioners in foreseeing
the challenges of ML systems engineering; (2) researchers and academicians in
identifying potential research questions; and (3) educators in designing or
updating SE courses to cover ML systems engineering.

283,"  Engineering Thermodynamics has been the core course of many science and
engineering majors around the world, including energy and power, mechanical
engineering, civil engineering, aerospace, cryogenic refrigeration, food
engineering, chemical engineering, and environmental engineering, among which
gas power cycle is one of the important contents. However, many Engineering
Thermodynamics textbooks focus only on evaluating the thermal efficiency of gas
power cycle, while the important concept of specific cycle work is ignored.
Based on the generalized temperature-entropy diagram for the gas power cycles
proposed by the authors, an ideal Otto cycle and an ideal Miller-Diesel cycle
are taking as examples for the thermodynamic analyses of gas power cycles. The
optimum compression ratio (or the pressure ratio) for the maximum specific
cycle work or the maximum mean effective pressure is analyzed and determined.
The ideal Otto and the ideal Miller-Diesel cycles, and also other gas power
cycles for movable applications, are concluded that the operation under the
maximum specific cycle work or the maximum mean effective pressure, instead of
under the higher efficiency, is more economic and more reasonable. We concluded
that the very important concept, i.e., the optimum compression (or pressure)
ratio for the gas power cycles, should be emphasized in the Engineering
Thermodynamics teaching process and in the latter revised or the newly edited
textbooks, in order to better guide the engineering applications.

284,"  A subset of type Ic supernovae (SNe Ic), broad-lined SNe Ic (SNe Ic-bl), show
unusually high kinetic energies ($\sim 10^{52}$ erg) which cannot be explained
by the energy supplied by neutrinos alone. Many SNe Ic-bl have been observed in
coincidence with long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) which suggests a connection
between SNe and GRBs. A small fraction of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) form
a rapidly-rotating and strongly-magnetized protoneutron star (PNS), a
proto-magnetar. Jets from such magnetars can provide the high kinetic energies
observed in SNe Ic-bl and also provide the connection to GRBs. In this work we
use the jetted outflow produced in a 3D CCSN simulation from a consistently
formed proto-magnetar as the central engine for full-star explosion
simulations. We extract a range of central engine parameters and find that the
extracted engine energy is in the range of $6.231 \times 10^{51}-1.725 \times
10^{52}$ erg, the engine time-scale in the range of $0.479-1.159$ s and the
engine half-opening angle in the range of $\sim 9-19^{\circ}$. Using these as
central engines, we perform 2D special-relativistic (SR) hydrodynamic (HD) and
radiation transfer simulations to calculate the corresponding light curves and
spectra. We find that these central engine parameters successfully produce SNe
Ic-bl which demonstrates that jets from proto-magnetars can be viable engines
for SNe Ic-bl. We also find that only the central engines with smaller opening
angles ($\sim 10^{\circ}$) form a GRB implying that GRB formation is likely
associated with narrower jet outflows and Ic-bl's without GRBs may be
associated with wider outflows.

285,"  Macroscopic cyclic heat engines have been a major motivation for the
emergence of thermodynamics. In the last decade, cyclic heat engines that have
large fluctuations and operate at finite time were studied within the more
modern framework of stochastic thermodynamics. The second law for such heat
engines states that the efficiency cannot be larger than the Carnot efficiency.
The concept of cyclic active heat engines for a system in the presence of
hidden dissipative degrees of freedom, also known as a nonequilibrium or active
reservoir, has also been studied in theory and experiment. Such active engines
show rather interesting behavior such as an ``efficiency'' larger than the
Carnot bound. They are also likely to play an important role in future
developments, given the ubiquitous presence of active media. However, a general
second law for cyclic active heat engines has been lacking so far. Here, upon
using a known inequality in stochastic stochastic thermodynamics for the excess
entropy, we obtain a general second law for active heat engines, which does not
involve the energy dissipation of the hidden degrees of freedom and is
expressed in terms of quantities that can be measured directly from the
observable degrees of freedom. Besides heat and work, our second law contains
an information-theoretic term, which allows an active heat engine to extract
work beyond the limits valid for a passive heat engine. To obtain a second law
expressed in terms of observable variables in the presence of hidden degrees of
freedom we introduce a coarse-grained excess entropy and prove a fluctuation
theorem for this quantity.

286,"  It is investigated whether non-Markovianity, i.e., the memory effects
resulting from the coupling of the system to its environment, can be beneficial
for the performance of quantum heat engines. Specifically, two physical models
are considered. The first one is a well known single-qubit Otto engine; the
non-Markovian behaviour is there implemented by replacing standard
thermalization strokes with so-called extremal thermal operations which cannot
be realized without the memory effects. The second one is a three-stroke engine
in which the cycle consists of two extremal thermal operations and a single
qubit rotation. It is shown that the non-Markovian Otto engine can generate
more work-per-cycle for a given efficiency than its Markovian counterpart,
whereas performance of both setups is superior to the three-stroke engine.
Furthermore, both the non-Markovian Otto engine and the three-stroke engine can
reduce the work fluctuations in comparison with the Markovian Otto engine, with
their relative advantage depending on the performance target. This demonstrates
the beneficial influence of non-Markovianity on both the average performance
and the stability of operation of quantum heat engines.

287,"  Search engines decide what we see for a given search query. Since many people
are exposed to information through search engines, it is fair to expect that
search engines are neutral. However, search engine results do not necessarily
cover all the viewpoints of a search query topic, and they can be biased
towards a specific view since search engine results are returned based on
relevance, which is calculated using many features and sophisticated algorithms
where search neutrality is not necessarily the focal point. Therefore, it is
important to evaluate the search engine results with respect to bias. In this
work we propose novel web search bias evaluation measures which take into
account the rank and relevance. We also propose a framework to evaluate web
search bias using the proposed measures and test our framework on two popular
search engines based on 57 controversial query topics such as abortion, medical
marijuana, and gay marriage. We measure the stance bias (in support or
against), as well as the ideological bias (conservative or liberal). We observe
that the stance does not necessarily correlate with the ideological leaning,
e.g. a positive stance on abortion indicates a liberal leaning but a positive
stance on Cuba embargo indicates a conservative leaning. Our experiments show
that neither of the search engines suffers from stance bias. However, both
search engines suffer from ideological bias, both favouring one ideological
leaning to the other, which is more significant from the perspective of
polarisation in our society.

288,"  Context: Advances in technical debt research demonstrate the benefits of
applying the financial debt metaphor to support decision-making in software

engineering has significant consequences, the debt metaphor in requirements
engineering is inadequately explored. Objective: We aim to conceptualize how
the debt metaphor applies to requirements engineering by organizing concepts
related to practitioners' understanding and managing of requirements
engineering debt (RED). Method: We conducted two in-depth expert interviews to
identify key requirements engineering debt concepts and construct a survey
instrument. We surveyed 69 practitioners worldwide regarding their perception
of the concepts and developed an initial analytical theory. Results: We propose
a RED theory that aligns key concepts from technical debt research but
emphasizes the specific nature of requirements engineering. In particular, the
theory consists of 23 falsifiable propositions derived from the literature, the
interviews, and survey results. Conclusions: The concepts of requirements
engineering debt are perceived to be similar to their technical debt
counterpart. Nevertheless, measuring and tracking requirements engineering debt
are immature in practice. Our proposed theory serves as the first guide toward
further research in this area.

289,"  Context: Software development is human-centric and vulnerable to human error.
Human errors are errors in the human thought process. To ensure software
quality, practitioners must understand how to manage these human errors.
Organizations often change the requirements engineering process to prevent
human errors from occurring or to mitigate the harm caused when those errors do
occur. While there are studies on human error management in other disciplines,
research on the prevention and mitigation of human errors in software
engineering, and requirements engineering specifically, are limited. The
software engineering studies do not provide strong results about the types of
changes that are most effective in requirements engineering. Objective: The
goal of this paper is to develop a taxonomy of human error prevention and
mitigation strategies based on data from requirements engineering
professionals. Method: We performed a qualitative analysis of two practitioner
surveys on requirements engineering practices to identify and classify
strategies for the prevention and mitigation of human errors. Results: We
organized the human error management strategies into a taxonomy based on
whether they primarily affect People, Processes, or the Environment. Inside
each high-level category, we further organized the strategies into low-level
classes. More than 50% of the reported strategies require a change in Process,
23% require a change in Environment, 21% require a change in People, with the
remaining 5% too ambiguous to classify. In addition, more than 50\% of the
strategies focus on Management activities. Conclusions: The Human Error
Management Taxonomy provides a systematic classification and organization of
strategies for prevention and mitigation of human errors in requirements
engineering. This systematic organization provides a foundation upon which
research can build.

290,"  We demonstrate that the efficiency of effective negative temperature-based
quantum Otto engines, already known to outperform their traditional
counterparts operating with positive-temperature thermal reservoirs, can be
further improved by terminating the isochoric strokes before the working
substance reaches perfect equilibrium with its environment. Our investigation
encompasses both Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics during these finite-time
isochoric processes while considering a weak coupling between the working
substance and the reservoirs. We assess the performance of these engines as
they undergo a transition from the Markovian to the non-Markovian regime using
two figures of merit: maximum achievable efficiency at a certain finite time
during the isochoric heating stroke, and overall performance of the engine over
an extended period during the transient phase of this stroke. We show that the
maximum efficiency increases with the increase of non-Markovianity. However,
the overall engine performance decreases as non-Markovianity increases.
Additionally, we discover the existence of effective negative temperature-based
necessarily transient quantum Otto engines. These engines operate within an
extended operational domain, reaching into temperature ranges where
conventional effective negative temperature-based quantum Otto engines, which
rely on perfect thermalization during the isochoric strokes, are unable to
function. Furthermore, this extended operational domain of an effective
negative temperature-based necessarily transient quantum Otto engine increases
as non-Markovianity becomes more pronounced.

292,"  Digital twin (DT) technology has received immense attention over the years
due to the promises it presents to various stakeholders in science and
engineering. As a result, different thematic areas of DT have been explored.
This is no different in specific fields such as manufacturing, automation, oil
and gas, and civil engineering, leading to fragmented approaches for
field-specific applications. The civil engineering industry is further
disadvantaged in this regard as it relies on external techniques by other
engineering fields for its DT adoption. A rising consequence of these
extensions is a concentrated application of DT to the operations and
maintenance phase. On another spectrum, Building Information Modeling (BIM) is

as a concept and as a service, and establish a five-level scale system.
Furthermore, we present separately a systematic literature review of the
conventional techniques employed at each civil engineering phase. In this
regard, we identified enabling technologies such as computer vision for
extended sensing and the Internet of Things for reliable integration.
Ultimately, we attempt to reveal DT as an important tool across the entire life

293,"  This paper introduces a quantum heat engine model that utilizes an ultracold
atomic gas coupled with a nanomechanical mirror. The mirror's vibration induces
an opto-mechanical sideband in the control field, affecting the behavior of the
cold gas and subsequently influencing the output radiation of the engine. The
model incorporates mirror vibration while omitting cavity confinement,
establishing a bridge between a multi-level atom-laser interacting system that
plays with coherences and the mechanical vibration of the nanomechanical
mirror, which jointly function as heat engines. Three distinct heat engine
configurations are proposed: the first involves a vibration-free three-level
$\Lambda$-type system, the second introduces nanomechanical vibration to the
three-level $\Lambda$-type system, and the third constitutes a composite engine
that combines the previous setups along with nanomechanical vibration. The
spectral brightness of a three-level heat engine is diminished with mirror
vibration, whereas for a composite heat engine, there is a slight enhancement
in the brightness peak. However, the maximum brightness is attained when there
is no vibration. Comparisons between the proposed model and an ideal system are
made regarding entropy balance, adhering to the constraints of the second law
of thermodynamics. The model observed that when subjected to mirror vibration,
the proposed heat engines diverged from the characteristics expected in an

girls to pursue software engineering careers and raise awareness about
diversity within the field. Similarly, software companies have become more
active in diversity and inclusion (D&I) topics, aiming to create more inclusive
work environments. However, the way diversity and inclusion are approached
inside software engineering university education remains less clear. This study
investigates the current state of D&I in software engineering education and
faculties in Finland. An online survey (N=30) was conducted among Finnish
software engineering university teachers to investigate which approaches and
case examples of D&I are most commonly used by software engineering teachers in
Finland. In addition, it was researched how software engineering teachers
perceive the importance of D&I in their courses. As a result of the
quantitative and thematic analysis, a framework to identify attitudes,
approaches, challenges and pedagogical strategies when implementing D&I themes

295,"  Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced software engineering
(SE) tasks, with prompt engineering techniques enhancing their performance in
code-related areas. However, the rapid development of foundational LLMs such as
the non-reasoning model GPT-4o and the reasoning model o1 raises questions
about the continued effectiveness of these prompt engineering techniques. This
paper presents an extensive empirical study that reevaluates various prompt
engineering techniques within the context of these advanced LLMs. Focusing on
three representative SE tasks, i.e., code generation, code translation, and
code summarization, we assess whether prompt engineering techniques still yield
improvements with advanced models, the actual effectiveness of reasoning models
compared to non-reasoning models, and whether the benefits of using these
advanced models justify their increased costs. Our findings reveal that prompt
engineering techniques developed for earlier LLMs may provide diminished
benefits or even hinder performance when applied to advanced models. In
reasoning LLMs, the ability of sophisticated built-in reasoning reduces the
impact of complex prompts, sometimes making simple zero-shot prompting more
effective. Furthermore, while reasoning models outperform non-reasoning models
in tasks requiring complex reasoning, they offer minimal advantages in tasks
that do not need reasoning and may incur unnecessary costs. Based on our study,
we provide practical guidance for practitioners on selecting appropriate prompt
engineering techniques and foundational LLMs, considering factors such as task
requirements, operational costs, and environmental impact. Our work contributes
to a deeper understanding of effectively harnessing advanced LLMs in SE tasks,
informing future research and application development.

296,"  This paper presents a physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach for
monitoring the health of diesel engines. The aim is to evaluate the engine
dynamics, identify unknown parameters in a ""mean value"" model, and anticipate
maintenance requirements. The PINN model is applied to diesel engines with a
variable-geometry turbocharger and exhaust gas recirculation, using measurement
data of selected state variables. The results demonstrate the ability of the
PINN model to predict simultaneously both unknown parameters and dynamics
accurately with both clean and noisy data, and the importance of the
self-adaptive weight in the loss function for faster convergence. The input
data for these simulations are derived from actual engine running conditions,
while the outputs are simulated data, making this a practical case study of
PINN's ability to predict real-world dynamical systems. The mean value model of
the diesel engine incorporates empirical formulae to represent certain states,
but these formulae may not be generalizable to other engines. To address this,
the study considers the use of deep neural networks (DNNs) in addition to the
PINN model. The DNNs are trained using laboratory test data and are used to
model the engine-specific empirical formulae in the mean value model, allowing
for a more flexible and adaptive representation of the engine's states. In
other words, the mean value model uses both the PINN model and the DNNs to
represent the engine's states, with the PINN providing a physics-based
understanding of the engine's overall dynamics and the DNNs offering a more
engine-specific and adaptive representation of the empirical formulae. By
combining these two approaches, the study aims to offer a comprehensive and
versatile approach to monitoring the health and performance of diesel engines.

299,"  The performance in finite time of a discrete heat engine with internal
friction is analyzed. The working fluid of the engine is composed of an
ensemble of noninteracting two level systems. External work is applied by
changing the external field and thus the internal energy levels. The friction
induces a minimal cycle time. The power output of the engine is optimized with
respect to time allocation between the contact time with the hot and cold baths
as well as the adiabats. The engine's performance is also optimized with
respect to the external fields. By reversing the cycle of operation a heat pump
is constructed. The performance of the engine as a heat pump is also optimized.
By varying the time allocation between the adiabats and the contact time with
the reservoir a universal behavior can be identified. The optimal performance
of the engine when the cold bath is approaching absolute zero is studied. It is
found that the optimal cooling rate converges linearly to zero when the
temperature approaches absolute zero.

301,"  We consider a class of quantum heat engines consisting of two subsystems
interacting via a unitary transformation and coupled to two separate baths at
different temperatures $T_h > T_c$. The purpose of the engine is to extract
work due to the temperature difference. Its dynamics is not restricted to the
near equilibrium regime. The engine structure is determined by maximizing the
extracted work under various constraints. When this maximization is carried out
at finite power, the engine dynamics is described by well-defined temperatures
and satisfies the local version of the second law. In addition, its efficiency
is bounded from below by the Curzon-Ahlborn value $1-\sqrt{T_c/T_h}$ and from
above by the Carnot value $1-(T_c/T_h)$. The latter is reached|at finite
power|for a macroscopic engine, while the former is achieved in the equilibrium
limit $T_h\to T_c$. When the work is maximized at a zero power, even a small
(few-level) engine extracts work right at the Carnot efficiency.

307,"  It is shown that in theories of gravity where the cosmological constant is
considered a thermodynamic variable, it is natural to use black holes as heat
engines. Two examples are presented in detail using AdS charged black holes as
the working substance. We notice that for static black holes, the maximally
efficient traditional Carnot engine is also a Stirling engine. The case of
negative cosmological constant supplies a natural realization of these engines
in terms of the field theory description of the fluids to which they are
holographically dual. We first propose a precise picture of how the traditional
thermodynamic dictionary of holography is extended when the cosmological
constant is dynamical and then conjecture that the engine cycles can be
performed by using renormalization group flow. We speculate about the existence
of a natural dual field theory counterpart to the gravitational thermodynamic

engine constructed by manipulating a Brownian particle in a time dependent
harmonic potential. The cycle consists of two isothermal steps at different
temperatures and two adiabatic steps similar to that of a Carnot engine. The
engine shows qualitative differences in inertial and overdamped regimes. All
the thermodynamic quantities, including efficiency, exhibit strong fluctuations
in a time periodic steady state. The fluctuations of stochastic efficiency
dominate over the mean values even in the quasistatic regime. Interestingly,
our system acts as an engine provided the temperature difference between the
two reservoirs is greater than a finite critical value which in turn depends on
the cycle time and other system parameters. This is supported by our analytical
results carried out in the quasistatic regime. Our system works more reliably
as an engine for large cycle times. By studying various model systems we
observe that the operational characteristics are model dependent. Our results
clearly rules out any universal relation between efficiency at maximum power
and temperature of the baths. We have also verified fluctuation relations for
heat engines in time periodic steady state.

315,"  We introduce a simple two-level heat engine to study the efficiency in the
condition of the maximum power output, depending on the energy levels from
which the net work is extracted. In contrast to the quasi-statically operated
Carnot engine whose efficiency reaches the theoretical maximum, recent research
on more realistic engines operated in finite time has revealed other classes of
efficiency such as the Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency maximizing the power output.
We investigate yet another side with our heat engine model, which consists of
pure relaxation and net work extraction processes from the population
difference caused by different transition rates. Due to the nature of our
model, the time-dependent part is completely decoupled from the other terms in
the generated work. We derive analytically the optimal condition for transition
rates maximizing the generated power output and discuss its implication on
general premise of realistic heat engines. In particular, the optimal engine
efficiency of our model is different from the Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency,
although they share the universal linear and quadratic coefficients at the
near-equilibrium limit. We further confirm our results by taking an alternative
approach in terms of the entropy production at hot and cold reservoirs.

errors introduced by human cognitive biases. Although extensively explored in
cognitive psychology, investigations concerning cognitive biases have only
recently gained popularity in software engineering (SE) research. This paper
therefore systematically maps, aggregates and synthesizes the literature on
cognitive biases in software engineering to generate a comprehensive body of
knowledge, understand state of the art research and provide guidelines for
future research and practise. Focusing on bias antecedents, effects and
mitigation techniques, we identified 65 articles, which investigate 37
cognitive biases, published between 1990 and 2016. Despite strong and
increasing interest, the results reveal a scarcity of research on mitigation
techniques and poor theoretical foundations in understanding and interpreting
cognitive biases. Although bias-related research has generated many new

are beginning to make both qualitative and quantitative predictions. Although
the evidence in support of the convective engine for core-collapse supernova
continues to grow, it is difficult to place quantitative constraints on this
engine. Some studies have made specific predictions for the remnant
distribution from the convective engine, but the results differ between
different groups. Here we use a broad parameterization for the supernova engine
to understand the differences between distinct studies. With this broader set
of models, we place error bars on the remnant mass and basic yields from the
uncertainties in the explosive engine. We find that, even with only 3

319,"  Self-adaptive software systems are often structured into an adaptation engine
that manages an adaptable software by operating on a runtime model that
represents the architecture of the software (model-based architectural
self-adaptation). Despite the popularity of such approaches, existing exemplars
provide application programming interfaces but no runtime model to develop
adaptation engines. Consequently, there does not exist any exemplar that
supports developing, evaluating, and comparing model-based self-adaptation off
the shelf. Therefore, we present mRUBiS, an extensible exemplar for model-based
architectural self-healing and self-optimization. mRUBiS simulates the
adaptable software and therefore provides and maintains an architectural
runtime model of the software, which can be directly used by adaptation engines
to realize and perform self-adaptation. Particularly, mRUBiS supports injecting
issues into the model, which should be handled by self-adaptation, and
validating the model to assess the self-adaptation. Finally, mRUBiS allows
developers to explore variants of adaptation engines (e.g., event-driven

Furthermore, we conjecture that (c) test case prioritization and (d) static

321,"  Although classical and quantum heat engines work on entirely different
fundamental principles, there is an underlying similarity. For instance, the
form of efficiency at optimal performance may be similar for both types of
engines. In this work, we study a three-level laser quantum heat engine
operating at maximum ecological function (EF) which represents a compromise
between the power output and the loss of power due to entropy production. We
derive analytic expressions for efficiency under the assumptions of strong
matter-field coupling and high bath temperatures. Upper and lower bounds on the
efficiency exist in case of extreme asymmetric dissipation when the ratio of
system-bath coupling constants at the hot and the cold contacts respectively
approaches, zero or infinity. These bounds have been established previously for
various classical models of Carnot-like engines. We conclude that while the
engine produces at least 75\% of the power output as compared with the maximum
power conditions, the fractional loss of power is appreciably low in case of
the engine operating at maximum EF, thus making this objective function
relevant from an environmental point of view.

322,"  Established heat engines in quantum regime can be modeled with various
quantum systems as working substances. For example, in the non-relativistic
case, we can model the heat engine using infinite potential well as a working
substance to evaluate the efficiency and work done of the engine. Here, we
propose quantum heat engine with a relativistic particle confined in the
one-dimensional potential well as working substance. The cycle comprises of two
isothermal processes and two potential well processes of equal width, which
forms the quantum counterpart of the known isochoric process in classical
nature. For a concrete interpretation about the relation between the quantum
observables with the physically measurable parameters (like the efficiency and
work done), we develop a link between the thermodynamic variables and the
uncertainty relation. We have used this model to explore the work extraction
and the efficiency of the heat engine for a relativistic case from the
standpoint of uncertainty relation, where the incompatible observables are the
position and the momentum operators. We are able to determine the bounds (the
upper and the lower bounds) of the efficiency of the heat engine through the
thermal uncertainty relation.

325,"  The efficiency of macroscopic heat engines is restricted by the second law of
thermodynamics. They can reach at most the efficiency of a Carnot engine. In
contrast, heat currents in mesoscopic heat engines show fluctuations. Thus,
there is a small probability that a mesoscopic heat engine exceeds Carnot's
maximum value during a short measurement time. We illustrate this effect using
a quantum point contact as a heat engine. When a temperature difference is
applied to a quantum point contact, the system may be utilized as a source of
electrical power under steady state conditions. We first discuss the optimal
working point of such a heat engine that maximizes the generated electrical
power and subsequently calculate the statistics for deviations of the
efficiency from its most likely value. We find that deviations surpassing the
Carnot limit are possible, but unlikely.

326,"  The difference between quantum isoenergetic process and quantum isothermal
process comes from the violation of the law of equipartition of energy in the
quantum regime. To reveal an important physical meaning of this fact, here we
study a special type of quantum heat engine consisting of three processes:
isoenergetic, isothermal and adiabatic processes. Therefore, this engine works
between the energy and heat baths. Combining two engines of this kind, it is
possible to realize the quantum Carnot engine. Furthermore, considering finite
velocity of change of the potential shape, here an infinite square well with
moving walls, the power output of the engine is discussed. It is found that the
efficiency and power output are both closely dependent on the initial and final
states of the quantum isothermal process. The performance of the engine cycle
is shown to be optimized by control of the occupation probability of the ground
state, which is determined by the temperature and the potential width. The
relation between the efficiency and power output is also discussed.

327,"  The Carnot heat engine sets an upper bound on the efficiency of a heat
engine. As an ideal, reversible engine, a single cycle must be performed in
infinite time, and so the Carnot engine has zero power. However, there is
nothing in principle forbidding the existence of a heat engine whose efficiency
approaches that of Carnot while maintaining finite power. Such an engine must
have very special properties, some of which have been discussed in the
literature, in various limits. While recent theorems rule out a large class of
engines from maintaining finite power at exactly the Carnot efficiency, the
approach to the limit still merits close study. Presented here is an exactly
solvable model of such an approach that may serve as a laboratory for
exploration of the underlying mechanisms. The equations of state have their
origins in the extended thermodynamics of electrically charged black holes.

328,"  We analyze an engine whose working fluid consists of a single quantum
particle, paralleling Szilard's construction of a classical single-particle
engine. Following his resolution of Maxwell's Second Law paradox using the
latter, which turned on physically instantiating the demon (control subsystem),
the quantum engine's design mirrors the classically-chaotic Szilard Map that
operates a thermodynamic cycle of measurement, thermal-energy extraction, and
memory reset. Focusing on the thermodynamic costs to observe and control the
particle and comparing these in the quantum and classical limits, we detail the
thermodynamic tradeoffs behind Landauer's Principle for
information-processing-induced thermodynamic dissipation in the quantum and
classical regimes. In particular, and as found with the classical engine, we
show that the sum of the thermodynamic costs over a cycle obeys a generalized
Landauer Principle, exactly balancing energy extraction from the heat bath.
Thus, the quantum engine obeys the Second Law. However, the quantum engine does
so via substantially different mechanisms: classically measurement and erasure
determine the thermodynamics, while in the quantum implementation the cost of
partition insertion is key.

the advantage of quantum batteries. Here, we introduce a feasible structure
engineering scheme that is applicable to spin-based open quantum batteries. Our

336,"  Software engineering has long studied how software developers work, building
a body of work which forms the foundation of many software engineering best
practices, tools, and theories. Recently, some developers have begun recording
videos of themselves engaged in programming tasks contributing to open source
projects, enabling them to share knowledge and socialize with other developers.
We believe that these videos offer an important opportunity for both software
engineering research and education. In this paper, we discuss the potential use
of these videos as well as open questions for how to best enable this
envisioned use. We propose creating a central repository of programming videos,
enabling analyzing and annotating videos to illustrate specific behaviors of
interest such as asking and answering questions, employing strategies, and
software engineering theories. Such a repository would offer an important new
way in which both software engineering researchers and students can understand
how software developers work.

337,"  The topic of microscopic heat engine has undergone intensive research in
recent years. Microscopic heat engines can exploit thermal as well as active
fluctuations to extract thermodynamic work. We investigate the properties of a
microscopic Stirling's engine that uses an active (self-propelling) particle as
a working substance, in contact with two thermal baths. It is shown that the
presence of activity leads to an enhanced performance of the engine. The
efficiency can be improved by increasing the activity strength for all cycle
time, including the non-quasistatic regime. We verify that the analytical
results agree very well with our simulations. The variation of efficiency with
the temperature difference between the two thermal baths has also been
explored. The optimum region of operation of the engine has been deduced, by
using its efficient power as a quantifier. Finally, a simple model is provided
that emulates the behaviour of a flywheel driven by this engine.

Whilst statistics support the notion that Finland is performing well compared
to many other countries in terms of workplace equality, there are still many

in obtaining software engineering roles. We report a preliminary analysis of
survey data from 252 respondents. These are mainly women who have shown an
interest in gaining programming roles by joining the Mimmit koodaa initiative,
which aims to increase equality and diversity within the software industry. The
survey sought to understand what early experiences may influence later career
choices and feelings of efficacy and confidence needed to pursue
technology-related careers. These initial findings reveal that women's feelings
of computing self-efficacy and attitudes towards software engineering are
shaped by early experiences. More negative experiences decrease the likelihood
of working in software engineering roles in the future, despite expressing an

339,"  Representative sampling appears rare in empirical software engineering
research. Not all studies need representative samples, but a general lack of
representative sampling undermines a scientific field. This article therefore
reports a critical review of the state of sampling in recent, high-quality
software engineering research. The key findings are: (1) random sampling is
rare; (2) sophisticated sampling strategies are very rare; (3) sampling,
representativeness and randomness often appear misunderstood. These findings
suggest that software engineering research has a generalizability crisis. To
address these problems, this paper synthesizes existing knowledge of sampling
into a succinct primer and proposes extensive guidelines for improving the
conduct, presentation and evaluation of sampling in software engineering
research. It is further recommended that while researchers should strive for
more representative samples, disparaging non-probability sampling is generally
capricious and particularly misguided for predominately qualitative research.

the heart of current condensed matter research. Most of these efforts focus on
single-particle properties neglecting possible engineering routes via the
modifications of the fundamental many-body interactions. Interestingly, recent
experimental breakthroughs have shown that Coulomb interactions can be
efficiently controlled by substrate screening engineering. Inspired by this
success } we propose a simple platform in which topologically non-trivial
many-body excitations emerge solely from dielectrically-engineered Coulomb
interactions in an otherwise topologically trivial single-particle band
structure. Furthermore, by performing a realistic microscopic modeling of

one-dimensional systems such as quantum-dot chains. Our results put forward
Coulomb engineering as a powerful tool to create topological excitations, with
potential applications in a variety of solid-state platforms.

343,"  Recent predictions for quantum-mechanical enhancements in the operation of
small heat engines have raised renewed interest in their study from both a
fundamental perspective and in view of applications. One essential question is
whether collective effects may help to carry enhancements over larger scales,
when increasing the number of systems composing the working substance of the
engine. Such enhancements may consider not only power and efficiency, that is
its performance, but, additionally, its constancy, i.e. the stability of the
engine with respect to unavoidable environmental fluctuations. We explore this
issue by introducing a many-body quantum heat engine model composed by spin
pairs working in continuous operation. We study how power, efficiency and
constancy scale with the number of spins composing the engine and introduce a
well-defined macroscopic limit where analytical expressions are obtained. Our
results predict power enhancements, both in finite-size and macroscopic cases,
for a broad range of system parameters and temperatures, without compromising
the engine efficiency, accompanied by coherence-enhanced constancy for finite
sizes. We discuss these quantities in connection to Thermodynamic Uncertainty
Relations (TUR).

344,"  The field of structural engineering is vast, spanning areas from the design
of new infrastructure to the assessment of existing infrastructure. From the
onset, traditional entry-level university courses teach students to analyse
structural response given data including external forces, geometry, member
sizes, restraint, etc. -- characterising a forward problem (structural
causalities $\to$ structural response). Shortly thereafter, junior engineers
are introduced to structural design where they aim to, for example, select an
appropriate structural form for members based on design criteria, which is the
inverse of what they previously learned. Similar inverse realisations also hold
true in structural health monitoring and a number of structural engineering
sub-fields (response $\to$ structural causalities). In this light, we aim to
demonstrate that many structural engineering sub-fields may be fundamentally or
partially viewed as inverse problems and thus benefit via the rich and
established methodologies from the inverse problems community. To this end, we
conclude that the future of inverse problems in structural engineering is
inexorably linked to engineering education and machine learning developments.

345,"  An active environment is a reservoir containing \emph{active} materials, such
as bacteria and Janus particles. Given the self-propelled motion of these
materials, powered by chemical energy, an active environment has unique,
nonequilibrium environmental noise. Recently, studies on engines that harvest
energy from active environments have attracted a great deal of attention
because the theoretical and experimental findings indicate that these engines
outperform conventional ones. Studies have explored the features of active
environments essential for outperformance, such as the non-Gaussian or
non-Markovian nature of the active noise. However, these features have not yet
been systematically investigated in a general setting. Therefore, we
systematically study the effects of the non-Gaussianity and non-Markovianity of
active noise on engine performance. We show that non-Gaussianity is irrelevant
to the performance of an engine driven by {any linear force (including a
harmonic trap) regardless of time dependency}, whereas non-Markovianity is
relevant. However, for a system driven by a general nonlinear force, both
non-Gaussianity and non-Markovianity enhance engine performance. Also, the
memory effect of an active reservoir should be considered when fabricating a
cyclic engine.

communities of practice. Consensus is important for maintaining legitimacy with
outsiders, orchestrating future research, developing educational curricula and
agreeing industry standards. Low consensus contrastingly undermines a field's
reputation and hinders peer review. Aim: This paper aims to investigate the
degree of consensus within the software engineering academic community
concerning members' implicit theories of software engineering. Method: A
convenience sample of 60 software engineering researchers produced diagrams
describing their personal understanding of causal relationships between core
software engineering constructs. The diagrams were then analyzed for patterns
and clusters. Results: At least three schools of thought may be forming;
however, their interpretation is unclear since they do not correspond to known
divisions within the community (e.g. Agile vs. Plan-Driven methods).
Furthermore, over one third of participants do not belong to any cluster.
Conclusion: Although low consensus is common in social sciences, the rapid pace
of innovation observed in software engineering suggests that high consensus is
achievable given renewed commitment to empiricism and evidence-based practice.

349,"  Gate camouflaging is a known security enhancement technique that tries to
thwart reverse engineering by hiding the functions of gates or the connections
between them. A number of works on SAT-based attacks have shown that it is
often possible to reverse engineer a circuit function by combining a
camouflaged circuit model and the ability to have oracle access to the
obfuscated combinational circuit. Especially in small circuits it is easy to
reverse engineer the circuit function in this way, but SAT-based reverse
engineering techniques provide no guarantees of recovering a circuit that is
gate-by-gate equivalent to the original design. In this work we show that an
attacker who does not know gate functions or connections of an aggressively
camouflaged circuit cannot learn the correct gate-level schematic even if able
to control inputs and probe all combinational nodes of the circuit. We then
present a stronger attack that extends SAT-based reverse engineering with fault
analysis to allow an attacker to recover the correct gate-level schematic. We
analyze our reverse engineering approach on an S-Box circuit.

350,"  In finite-time quantum heat engines, some work is consumed to drive a working
fluid accompanying coherence, which is called `friction'. To understand the
role of friction in quantum thermodynamics, we present a couple of finite-time
quantum Otto cycles with two different baths: Agarwal versus Lindbladian. We
solve them exactly and compare the performance of the Agarwal engine with that
of the Lindbladian engine. In particular, we find remarkable and
counterintuitive results that the performance of the Agarwal engine due to
friction can be much higher than that in the quasistatic limit with the Otto
efficiency, and the power of the Lindbladian engine can be nonzero in the
short-time limit. Based on additional numerical calculations of these outcomes,
we discuss possible origins of such differences between two engines and reveal
them. Our results imply that even with an equilibrium bath, a nonequilibrium
working fluid brings on the higher performance than what an equilibrium working
fluid does.
